Background USDA preparing establish Greenhouse Gas Technical Assistance Provider Third-Party Verifier Program ( Program ) , authorized provisions Growing Climate Solutions Act ( GCSA ) , signed law December 29 , 2022 , part Consolidated Appropriations Act 2023 ( Pub . L. 117–328 , div . HH , title , section 201 ) . purpose Program facilitate farmer , rancher , private forest landowner participation voluntary carbon markets . establishing Program , USDA ( 1 ) publish list , documents relating , widely accepted protocols designed ensure consistency , reliability , effectiveness , efficiency , transparency voluntary environmental credit markets ; ( 2 ) publish descriptions widely accepted qualifications possessed covered entities provide technical assistance farmers , ranchers , private forest landowners ; ( 3 ) publish list qualified technical assistance providers third-party verifiers ; ( 4 ) provide information assist farmers , ranchers , private forest landowners accessing voluntary environmental credit markets . Prior publication request information ( RFI ) directed GCSA , USDA completed analysis voluntary carbon markets published report , ‘ ‘ General Assessment Role Agriculture Forestry U.S . Carbon Markets ’ ’ .1 report concluded voluntary carbon markets offer promising tool achieve greenhouse gas ( GHG ) reductions agricultural forestry sectors . However , farmers , ranchers , private forest landowners face barriers accessing voluntary carbon markets due market confusion , high costs , project requirements . full discussion Program address barriers facilitate producer participation voluntary carbon markets available report , ‘ ‘ USDA Intent Establish Greenhouse Gas Technical Assistance Provider Third-Party Verifier Program ’ ’ .2 RFI seeks public input options implementing Program . Specifically , USDA seeks input ( 1 ) options interpreting applying criteria used evaluate protocols designed ensure consistency , reliability , effectiveness , efficiency , transparency ; ( 2 ) information pertaining specific protocols evaluated inclusion program ; ( 3 ) qualifications needed covered entities serve technical assistance providers farmers , ranchers , private forest landowners ; ( 4 ) qualifications needed covered entities serve third-parties conduct verification processes described protocols voluntary environmental credit markets . information obtained considered determining next step , could include proposed rule . II . Request Information Commenters refer specific question numbers responses . Question 1 : USDA define terms ‘ ‘ consistency , ’ ’ ‘ ‘ reliability , ’ ’ ‘ ‘ effectiveness , ’ ’ ‘ ‘ efficiency , ’ ’ ‘ ‘ transparency ’ ’ ( see 7 U.S.C . 6712 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( ) ) use protocol evaluation ? Question 2 : metrics standards USDA use evaluate protocol ’ alignment five criteria defined Question 1 ? USDA consider minimum criteria protocol qualify listing Program ? Question 3 : general , new protocol published , long take project use protocol issued credits ( i.e. , lag VerDate Sep < 11 > 2014 16:36 May 28 , 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E : \FR\FM\29MYP1.SGM 29MYP1 lotter DSK11XQN23PROD PROPOSALS1 46336 Federal Register / Vol . 89 , . 104 / Wednesday , May 29 , 2024 / Proposed Rules time protocol publication first credit generation ) ? Question 4 : protocol ( ) generating voluntary carbon credits agriculture forestry projects USDA evaluate listing Greenhouse Gas Technical Assistance Provider Third-Party Verifier Program ? Question 5 : protocol ( ) identified Question 4 : ( ) protocol resulted generation sale credits ? yes , recent year volume credit generation retirement ? , evidence protocol generate credits ( e.g. , projects development ) ? ( b ) average size ( acres , hectares , another relevant unit ) projects using protocol ? ( c ) average credit issuance per unit land area ( acre hectare ) projects using protocol , inclusive credits contributed buffer pool ?

( ) protocol include risk management approach determining data inputs project sites required third-party verification ? yes , risk management approach require ? ( j ) protocol allow simplified measurement , monitoring , reporting , verification ( MMRV ) processes ? yes , requirements restrictions using simplified MMRV processes ? ( k ) quantification methodology ( ies ) protocol require quantification emissions reductions and/or removals ? scientific evidence available support methodologies ? ( l ) protocols models required quantify emissions , process model review approval prior use prospective projects ? approved models used project specific project developer ? ( ) models allowed quantification emissions reductions , models required gone scientific review , parameterization , calibration , validation demonstrate performance practices relevant crops and/or species geography project ? protocol provide clear guidance eligible models applied ? ( n ) protocol require allow determining project baseline ? ( ) registry administering protocol restrict potential double counting credits ? ( p ) protocol require projects quantify report uncertainty associated greenhouse gas calculations ? ( q ) protocol generated credits later cancelled due issues credit integrity validity ?
