Introduction ESDs SIB AB give people often-painful electric shock try make stop behaving ways harmful and/or dangerous often related underlying intellectual developmental disabilities . specifically , ESDs type aversive conditioning device apply noxious electrical stimulus ( shock ) person ’ skin attempt reduce cease self-injurious aggressive behaviors . SIB commonly includes head-banging , hand-biting , excessive scratching , picking skin . However , SIB extreme result bleeding ; broken , even protruding bones ; blindness eyegouging poking ; permanent tissue damage ; injuries swallowing dangerous objects substances . AB involve repeated physical assaults danger individual , others , property . proposed rule , like much scientific literature , discuss SIB AB tandem use phrase ‘ ‘ SIB AB ’ ’ refer SIB , AB , . detailed discussion SIB AB intellectual developmental disabilities relate individuals SIB AB found section I.B previous proposed rule ban devices ( 2016 Proposed Rule ) ( 81 FR 24386 24389 ) . ESDs subject proposed ban intended reduce SIB AB according principle aversive conditioning . Aversive conditioning pairs noxious stimulus ( , , noxious electric shock delivered individual ’ skin ) target behavior ; goal individual eventually associates noxious stimulus behavior . Pairing target behavior shocks ESD intended affect behavior two ways : interrupting target behavior immediate response stimulus—for example , response pain—and , time , conditioned reduction target behavior person learns associate shock target behavior ( learn control behavior ) . Associating unwanted behavior shock intended decrease frequency behavior stop altogether . However , explained , ESDs pose number serious risks shown effective , modern treatments SIB AB generally successful without involving use ESDs . State-of-theart treatments instead include conducting functional behavioral assessment determine causes triggers self-injury aggression , using information design plan supportive approaches , consisting multiple elements , modify behavior . cases , pharmacotherapy appropriate element treatment plan , depending specific patient . approaches generally successful , even difficult cases . use ESDs mostly abandoned decades ago , part shocks painful painful recipients . one facility United States still applies devices individuals . Although 2018 Massachusetts court found , purpose considering whether lift consent decree , professional consensus whether ESDs part standard care treating individuals intellectual developmental disabilities,1 professional consensus regarding accepted standard care use ESDs issue rulemaking ( see discussion 2020 Final Rule , 85 FR 13312 13314 13315 ) .

B . Need Regulation rulemaking would protect promote public health banning ESDs SIB AB , would prevent patient population subjected device poses substantial unreasonable risk illness injury . explained previous rulemaking ban ESDs SIB AB , people manifest SIB AB often intellectual developmental disabilities including , limited , autism spectrum disorder , syndrome , Tourette syndrome , well cognitive psychiatric disorders severe intellectual impairment ( including broad range intellectual measures ) ( see , e.g. , 81 FR 24386 24389 ) . Notably , people intellectual developmental disabilities may difficulty communicating may able make treatment decisions disabilities ( see , e.g. , 85 FR 13312 13329 ) . , among reasons , means many people exhibit SIB AB constitute vulnerable population . people manifest SIB AB , ESDs intended conditions present substantial unreasonable risk illness injury corrected eliminated labeling change labeling . , ban devices intended uses warranted . discussed section IV , section 516 ( ) FD & C Act authorizes FDA ban device one intended uses , regulation , find , basis available data information , device presents substantial deception unreasonable substantial risk illness injury . Accordingly , based serious risks posed ESDs SIB AB , inadequacy data support effectiveness , positive benefit-risk profiles state-of-theart alternatives treatment SIB AB , FDA determined ESDs present unreasonable substantial risk illness injury corrected eliminated labeling . proposed rule would apply devices already distribution use , well future sale distribution devices . purpose notice seek comments FDA ’ proposal ban ESDs used SIB AB comments associated issues . Section V document discusses information data support proposed findings . C. FDA ’ Current Regulatory Framework FD & C Act , amended Medical Device Amendments 1976 ( 1976 Amendments ) ( Pub . L. 94–295 ) , establishes comprehensive system regulation medical devices intended human use . Section 513 FD & C Act establishes three categories ( classes ) devices , reflecting regulatory controls needed provide reasonable assurance safety effectiveness : class ( general controls ) , class II ( special controls ) , class III ( premarket approval ) ( see 21 U.S.C . 360c ) . 1979 , FDA classified aversive conditioning devices class II ( see § 882.5235 ( 21 CFR 882.5235 ) ) , consistent recommendation Neurological Device Classification Panel 1978 . Class II devices devices general controls insufficient provide reasonable assurance safety effectiveness , sufficient information establish special controls provide assurance , including promulgation performance standards , postmarket surveillance , patient registries , development dissemination guidelines , recommendations , appropriate actions Agency deems necessary provide assurance ( section 513 ( ) ( 1 ) ( B ) FD & C Act ) . Aversive conditioning devices , device type , administer electric shock another noxious stimulus patient modify undesirable behavioral characteristics ( see § 882.5235 ) . Thus , ESDs intended SIB AB , administer shocks modify target behaviors , within aversive conditioning device classification regulation . discussed detail section I.D . previous proposed rule ( 81 FR 24386 24391 ) , late 1970s , FDA panelists Neurological Device Classification Panel believed performance standards could adequately assure safety effectiveness aversives proposed classification accordingly . received comments public proposed rule , issued final rule classifying aversives proposed § 882.5235 ( 44 FR 51726 51765 , September 4 , 1979 ) . explained previous rulemaking ban ESDs SIB AB , remains true , FDA better understanding risks benefits presented devices 44 years ago devices classified . summarized section III.B explained fully section V.E . 2020 Final Rule , state art treatment SIB AB progressed significantly time period ( 85 FR 13312 13337 13344 ) . development scientific literature treatments conditions underscores risk illness injury use ESDs SIB AB unreasonable substantial . D. History Rulemaking FDA previously banned ESDs SIB AB final rule issued March 6 , 2020 , pursuant Agency ’ authority section 516 FD & C Act ( 85 FR 13312 13354 ) . Specifically , section 516 FD & C Act provides FDA may ban device intended human use Agency determines device presents substantial deception unreasonable substantial risk illness injury corrected eliminated labeling change labeling . Leading final ban , FDA held public meeting Neurological Devices Panel Medical Devices Advisory Committee April 24 , 2014 ( see 79 FR 17155 , March 27 , 2014 ) ( Ref . 1 ) , issued proposed ban Federal Register April 25 , 2016 , considered comments proposal interested stakeholders ( 81 FR 24386 ) . activities garnered significant interest , FDA received reviewed voluminous information develop final rule banning ESDs SIB AB .

FDA found weight evidence indicates ESDs SIB AB present number psychological physical risks . determined evidence establish ESDs improve underlying causative disorder effectively condition individuals achieve durable reduction SIB AB clinically meaningful period time . FDA also found weight evidence indicates state-of-the-art treatment individuals SIB AB relies multielement positive interventions , example , paradigms positive behavior support ( PBS ) dialectical behavioral therapy ( DBT ) , sometimes conjunction pharmacological treatments ( 85 FR 13312 13315 13337 ) . Even cases behavioral modification plans include punishment techniques , techniques significantly less intrusive ESDs inflict pain ; example , include timeouts .

Following court ’ decision , Congress enacted Food Drug Omnibus Reform Act 2022 ( FDORA ) ( Pub . L. 117–328 ) . FDORA amended section 516 ( ) FD & C Act expressly state FDA ’ authority ban device intended human use includes authority ban device one intended uses , device banned one intended uses legally marketed device section 1006 FD & C Act . amended , statute clear FDA may issue ban previous ban ESDs SIB AB , applies one specific intended uses . reviewing publications information become known Agency brief interim issuance previous ban 2020 , determining change conclusion ESDs SIB AB present unreasonable substantial risk illness injury corrected eliminated labeling change labeling , FDA proposing ban ESDs intended SIB AB section 516 FD & C Act , amended . IV . Legal Authority section 516 FD & C Act , FDA may ban device regulation find , basis available data information , device relevant intended use ( ) presents substantial deception unreasonable substantial risk illness injury corrected eliminated labeling change labeling ( see 21 U.S.C . 360f ( ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) , amended section 3306 FDORA ) . Section 3306 FDORA expressly provides FDA authority ban device one intended uses FDA ’ authority section 516 FD & C Act limited bans device intended uses . legislative history reinforces section 516 FD & C Act , amended , authorizes FDA ban device regardless whether ban includes devices technologically similar different intended uses ( see H.

FD & C Act defines various prohibited acts respecting adulterated devices ( see 21 U.S.C . 331 ) . proposed rule also issued section 701 ( ) FD & C Act , provides FDA authority issue regulations efficient enforcement FD & C Act ( see 21 U.S.C . 371 ( ) ) . rule , finalized , would enable FDA efficiently enforce FD & C Act . Part 895 sets forth regulations apply banning devices section 516 FD & C Act . Consistent regulations ( applicable legal provisions ) , proposing findings , based available information data , ESDs SIB AB present substantial unreasonable risk illness injury . determining whether risk illness injury ‘ ‘ substantial , ’ ’ FDA considers whether risk posed continued marketing device , continued marketing device presently labeled , important , material , significant relation benefit public health continued marketing ( see § 895.21 ( ) ( 1 ) ( 21 CFR 895.21 ( ) ( 1 ) ) ) . Although FDA ’ device banning regulations define ‘ ‘ unreasonable risk , ’ ’ explained preamble final rule establishing part 895 , respect ‘ ‘ unreasonable risk , ’ ’ conduct careful analysis risks associated use device relative state art potential hazard patients users ( 44 FR 29214 29215 , May 18 , 1979 ) . state art respect rule state current technical scientific knowledge medical practice regard treatment patients exhibiting self-injurious aggressive behavior . Thus , determining whether device presents ‘ ‘ unreasonable substantial risk illness injury ’ ’ one intended uses , FDA analyzes risks benefits device poses individuals used intended use uses , comparing risks benefits risks benefits posed alternative treatments used current medical practice . Actual proof illness injury required ; FDA need find device presents requisite degree risk basis available data information ( H. Rept . 94–853 19 ; 44 FR 29214 29215 ) . FDA determines risk corrected labeling , FDA notify responsible person required labeling change labeling necessary eliminate correct risk ( see 21 CFR 895.25 ) .
