See 35 U.S.C . 253 ( providing filing terminal disclaimer owner patent filed ) . proposed rule intended promote competition lowering cost challenging groups patents tied terminal disclaimers , resulting reduced barriers market entry lower costs consumers . proposed rule furthers objectives Executive Order 14036 ‘ ‘ Promoting Competition American Economy , ’ ’ 86 FR 36987 ( July 14 , 2021 ) . example proposed rule would lower costs challenging multiple related patents , litigation patent owner enforcing patent along several patents tied one terminal disclaimers patent , competitor could seek court narrow validity disputes address patent . Narrowing validity disputes litigation one patent could result focused claim construction hearings , lower litigation costs , faster resolution . Similarly , competitor could petition inter partes post-grant review single patent multiple patents tied one terminal disclaimers proposed agreement . outcome postgrant challenge claims selected patent may also resolve enforceability multiple patents tied selected patent . one patent challenged per post-grant petition , proposed terminal disclaimer rule would lower cost administrative proceedings enabling challenger seek freedom operate review one patent , opposed seeking review number patents claiming obvious variants single invention . . Background . Request Comments Whether Changes Need Made Patent System Regarding Nonstatutory Double Patenting recent request comments , USPTO sought public input whether changes needed terminal disclaimer practice help ensure U.S. patent system properly adequately protects innovation unnecessarily harming competition . See Request Comments USPTO Initiatives Ensure Robustness Reliability Patent Rights , 87 FR 60130 ( October 4 , 2022 ) ( ‘ ‘ Request Comments ’ ’ ) . Request Comments , USPTO recognized existing practice may adequately address concerns multiple patents directed obvious variants invention could deter competition number patents prohibitively expensive challenge post-grant proceedings PTAB district court . address issue , Request Comments asked whether applicants seeking patents obvious variations prior claims required stipulate claims patentably distinct previously considered claims condition filing terminal disclaimer obviate obviousness-type double patenting rejection . Request Comments also recognized , current practice , patents tied together terminal disclaimer obviousness-type double patenting rejection must separately challenged validity grounds . Request Comments asked whether filing terminal disclaimer patents admission obviousness , , whether patents , validity challenged issuance , stand fall together . USPTO received comments expressing range views questions posed Request Comments . comments supported stipulation requirement proposition filing terminal disclaimer admission obviousness patents tied terminal disclaimers stand fall together . include comments suggesting stipulation could clarify intrinsic record simplify subsequent litigation . comments stated stipulation admission could reduce cost risk challenging multiple duplicative patents lower drug prices drugs longer considered innovative . comments also indicated stipulation could create incentive applicants address nonstatutory double patenting questions merits would encourage innovators create inventions , stimulating investment innovation . comments opposed stipulation requirement proposition filing terminal disclaimer admission obviousness patents tied terminal disclaimers stand fall together . include comments asserting decision whether file terminal disclaimer often driven desire expedite prosecution reduce costs rather merits nonstatutory double patenting rejection , stipulation requirement would cause delays increase burdens applicants , and/or stipulation requirement would encourage applicants file large number claims single application . Comments opposed treating filing terminal disclaimer admission obviousness include comments citing SimpleAir , Inc. v. Google LLC , 884 F.3d 1160 ( Fed .

See MPEP 2288 . terminal disclaimer filed application , terminal disclaimer withdrawn patent issues application , patent containing withdrawn terminal disclaimer tied never tied patent identified withdrawn terminal disclaimer ( patent granted application identified withdrawn terminal disclaimer ) . b . Indirect Tying—By Two Terminal Disclaimers subject patent patent granted subject application tied indirectly two terminal disclaimers another patent : ( 1 ) terminal disclaimer filed subject patent application identifies intermediate patent/application reference patent application ; ( 2 ) terminal disclaimer filed intermediate patent/application identifies patent , application issued patent , reference patent application . illustrated example 2 section ( II ) ( ) ( 3 ) . discussed respect direct tying , terminal disclaimers may withdrawn application certain circumstances . following four illustrations show effect tying withdrawing terminal disclaimer intermediate application terminal disclaimer also filed subject application . ( 1 ) terminal disclaimer filed intermediate application identifies patent withdrawn patent granted subject application , patent granted subject application never tied indirectly patent . ( 2 ) terminal disclaimer filed intermediate application identifies patent withdrawn patent granted subject application , indirect tying patent undone patent granted subject application one point tied indirectly patent . ( 3 ) terminal disclaimer filed intermediate application identifies application later issues patent withdrawn patent granted subject application patent issues , patent granted subject application never tied indirectly patent . ( 4 ) terminal disclaimer filed intermediate application identifies application later issues patent withdrawn patent granted subject application patent issues , indirect tying patent undone patent granted subject application one point tied indirectly patent . Tying two terminal disclaimers illustrated example 3 section ( II ) ( ) ( 3 ) . ( 2 ) Meaning ‘ ‘ Claim Finally Held Unpatentable Invalid ’ ’ term ‘ ‘ finally held unpatentable ’ ’ refers final determination USPTO trial established Leahy-Smith America Invents Act ( AIA ) ( Pub . L. 112–29 ( 2011 ) ) reexamination proceeding one claims patent unpatentable appeals concluded appeal rights exhausted . term ‘ ‘ finally held . . . invalid ’ ’ relates final decision entered Federal court civil action holding one claims patent invalid appeals concluded appeal rights exhausted . proposed agreement independent relative timing terminal disclaimer final holding unpatentability invalidity prior art . Additionally , proposed agreement avoided filing statutory disclaimer claim 35 U.S.C . 253 ( ) challenge based 35 U.S.C . 102 103 claim made . ( 3 ) Examples following examples illustrate meaning : ( 1 ) direct indirect tying proposed rule , ( 2 ) possible consequences agreement proposed rule . examples , terminal disclaimers include agreement proposed rule filed obviate nonstatutory double patenting , unless otherwise noted . single capital letter identifies application patent issues application , letter ‘ ‘ ’ ’ parentheses used identify application letter ‘ ‘ P ’ ’ parentheses used identify patent . Thus , X ( P ) patent issued application X ( ) . arrow represents terminal disclaimer filed obviate nonstatutory double patenting . arrow starts subject patent application points toward reference patent application . patents applications examples may patent family different patent family . enumeration terminal disclaimers using terms ‘ ‘ first , ’ ’ ‘ ‘ second , ’ ’ etc . refer terminal disclaimers filed instead used identification purposes . Example 1 subject patent patent granted subject application tied directly reference patent patent granted reference application terminal disclaimer filed subject patent application obviate nonstatutory double patenting based reference patent application . Thus , terminal disclaimer filed X ( P ) X ( ) identifying W ( P ) W ( ) reference patent application , X ( P ) tied directly W ( P ) . Example 1 may represented visually : W ← X tying terminal disclaimer unidirectional . Therefore , example , W ( P ) tied X ( P ) terminal disclaimer filed X . example , X ( P ) subject patent patent granted subject application , W ( P ) reference patent patent granted reference application . result , claim W ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art , X ( P ) may enforced . However , claim X ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art , W ( P ) may still enforced terminal disclaimer agreement proposed rule filed W identifying X reference patent application . terminal disclaimer filed X ( ) withdrawn X ( ) issues patent , X ( P ) may enforced even claim W ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art X ( P ) never tied W ( P ) . explain example 1 practical terms . instance , applicant overcomes nonstatutory double VerDate Sep < 11 > 2014 18:55 May 09 , 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E : \FR\FM\10MYP1.SGM 10MYP1 khammond DSKJM1Z7X2PROD PROPOSALS Federal Register / Vol . 89 , . 92 / Friday , May 10 , 2024 / Proposed Rules 40443 patenting rejection application X ( ) based reference patent W ( P ) filing terminal disclaimer agreement proposed rule , thereby obtaining patent X ( P ) . current rule , patents X ( P ) W ( P ) may block competitors need separately invalidated licensed gain freedom operate . proposed rule , claim patent W ( P ) finally held invalid unpatentable prior art , competitors would avoid enforcement patent X ( P ) based agreement proposed rule terminal disclaimer patent X ( P ) . However , claim patent X ( P ) finally held invalid unpatentable prior art , competitors would able , solely basis , avoid enforcement patent W ( P ) terminal disclaimer containing proposed agreement filed W identifying X reference patent application . Additionally , multiple subject patents applications may terminal disclaimers identifying reference patent application . proposed rule , claim reference patent patent granted reference application finally held invalid unpatentable prior art , competitors would avoid enforcement multiple patents based proposed agreement terminal disclaimers filed patents . Example 2 Extending example 1 ( terminal disclaimer filed X includes proposed agreement ) , second terminal disclaimer filed ( P ) ( ) identifying X ( P ) X ( ) reference patent application , ( P ) tied indirectly W ( P ) . would case even X ( ) abandoned remains pending . Example 2 may represented visually : W ← X ← Consistent example 1 , ( P ) tied directly X ( P ) , X ( P ) tied directly W ( P ) . example , X ( P ) X ( ) , case may , intermediate patent/application two terminal disclaimers tie ( P ) W ( P ) . example , W ( P ) tied X ( P ) ( P ) , X ( P ) tied ( P ) . example , ( P ) subject patent patent granted subject application terminal disclaimer filed , W ( P ) reference patent patent granted reference application terminal disclaimer filed X . example , X intermediate patent/application reference patent application terminal disclaimer filed subject patent application terminal disclaimer filed X . result , claim W ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art , terminal disclaimer ( P ) contains proposed agreement , ( P ) may enforced . example 1 , claim W ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art , X ( P ) may enforced . Similarly , claim X ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art , ( P ) may enforced . terminal disclaimer filed X ( ) identifying W ( P ) withdrawn ( ) issues patent , ( P ) would still enforceable event claim W ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art ( P ) never tied W ( P ) . hand , terminal disclaimer filed X ( ) identifying W ( P ) withdrawn ( ) issued patent , ( P ) may enforced event claim W ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art ( P ) tied W ( P ) . Note even terminal disclaimer filed X contain proposed agreement ( filed prior implementation proposed rule ) , ( P ) still tied W ( P ) . situation , claim W ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art , X ( P ) may still enforced ( terminal disclaimer filed X contain proposed agreement ) even though ( P ) may enforced . Example 3 Indirect tying may also occur multiple intermediate patents/ applications . Extending example 2 , third terminal disclaimer filed Z ( P ) Z ( ) identifying ( P ) ( ) reference patent application , Z ( P ) tied indirectly W ( P ) . would case even X ( ) and/or ( ) are/is abandoned remain ( ) pending . Example 3 may represented visually : W ← X ← ← Z example , tying relationships example 2 remain . Also example , Z ( P ) subject patent patent granted subject application terminal disclaimer filed Z , W ( P ) reference patent patent granted reference application terminal disclaimer filed X. X ( P ) X ( ) ( P ) ( ) , case may , intermediate patents/applications three terminal disclaimers tie Z ( P ) W ( P ) . result , claim W ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art terminal disclaimer filed Z ( ) contains proposed agreement , Z ( P ) may enforced . example 2 , claim W ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art , ( P ) X ( P ) may enforced ; claim X ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art , ( P ) Z ( P ) may enforced ; claim ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art , Z ( P ) may enforced . Example 4 example shows three patents tied directly indirectly terminal disclaimers . example , first terminal disclaimer filed X ( P ) X ( ) identifying W ( P ) W ( ) reference patent application , directly tying X ( P ) W ( P ) . W ← X second terminal disclaimer filed W ( P ) W ( ) identifying X ( P ) X ( ) reference patent application , directly tying W ( P ) X ( P ) . W u X third terminal disclaimer filed ( P ) ( ) identifying X ( P ) X ( ) reference patent application , directly tying ( P ) X ( P ) .

Example 5 may represented visually : X → ← Z example , X ( P ) Z ( P ) tied directly ( P ) . result , claim ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art proposed agreement contained terminal disclaimers filed X Z , X ( P ) Z ( P ) enforced . However , Z ( P ) tied X ( P ) , X ( P ) tied Z ( P ) , ( P ) tied either X ( P ) Z ( P ) . Thus , claim X ( P ) Z ( P ) finally held unpatentable invalid prior art , effect whether two patents may enforced . ( 4 ) Ways Address Nonstatutory Double Patenting obviate nonstatutory double patenting , patent owners applicants voluntarily file terminal disclaimer proposed agreement . applicants patent owners concerned new requirement seek avoid consequences proposed agreement , applicants patent owners option filing terminal disclaimer proposed agreement . nonstatutory double patenting may dealt number ways . applicant facing nonstatutory double patenting rejection application number options avoid filing terminal disclaimer proposed agreement : ( 1 ) combining conflicting claims single application , ( 2 ) canceling amending conflicting claims application application containing conflicting claims formed basis nonstatutory double patenting , ( 3 ) arguing rejected claims application patentably distinct claims reference patent application , ( 4 ) filing reissue application patent whose claims formed basis nonstatutory double patenting order add canceled conflicting claims application reissue application , provided added claims introduce new matter reissue application .

Bankers Ass ’ n , 575 U.S. 92 , 97 , 101 ( 2015 ) ( explaining interpretive rules ‘ ‘ advise public agency ’ construction statutes rules administers ’ ’ require notice comment issued amended ) ; Cooper Techs . Co. v. Dudas , 536 F.3d 1330 , 1336–37 ( Fed . Cir . 2008 ) ( stating 5 U.S.C . 553 , thus 35 U.S.C . 2 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( B ) , require notice-and- comment rulemaking ‘ ‘ interpretative rules , general statements policy , rules agency organization , procedure , practice ’ ’ ) ; JEM Broadcasting Co. v . F.C.C. , 22 F.3d 320 , 328 ( D.C. Cir . 1994 ) ( explaining rules legislative ‘ ‘ foreclose effective opportunity make one ’ case merits ’ ’ ) . Nevertheless , USPTO publishing proposed rule comment seek benefit public ’ views Office ’ proposed regulatory changes . B . Regulatory Flexibility Act ( RFA ) following reasons , Senior Counsel Regulatory Legislative Affairs USPTO certified Chief Counsel Advocacy Small Business Administration rule significant economic impact substantial number small entities . See 5 U.S.C . 605 ( b ) . USPTO proposing revise enforcement provisions § 1.321 ( c ) ( ) require terminal disclaimer filed obviate nonstatutory double patenting include agreement disclaimant subject patent , patent granted subject application , shall enforceable patent tied never tied directly indirectly patent one terminal disclaimers filed obviate nonstatutory double patenting : ( 1 ) claim finally held unpatentable invalid 35 U.S.C . 102 103 Federal court civil action USPTO , appeal rights exhausted ; ( 2 ) statutory disclaimer claim filed challenge based 35 U.S.C . 102 103 claim made . Thus , rulemaking propose substantively change applicant patent owner may file terminal disclaimer § 1.321 . Small Business Administration ( SBA ) small business size standards applicable analyses conducted comply RFA set forth 13 CFR 121.201 . regulations generally define small businesses fewer specified maximum number employees less specified level annual receipts entity ’ industrial sector North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS ) code . provided RFA , consulting SBA , USPTO formally adopted alternate size standard purpose conducting analysis making certification RFA patent-related regulations .

Office 63 ( Dec. 12 , 2006 ) . purposes certification , USPTO defines small entities include entities paying small micro entity fee rates USPTO . USPTO estimates approximately 20 % applicants patent owners ( including small entity applicants patent owners , account approximately 27 % patent filings ) considering filing terminal disclaimer obviate nonstatutory double patenting opt file terminal disclaimer containing proposed agreement , least initial period effective date final rule . mentioned earlier herein , applicants patent owners choose file terminal disclaimer proposed agreement number alternatives obviate nonstatutory double patenting . USPTO estimates vast majority applicants patent owners choose file terminal disclaimer proposed agreement opt argue and/or amend claims obviate nonstatutory double patenting . number instances applicants patent owners obviate nonstatutory double patenting relatively low . USPTO issues roughly 650,000 nonfinal final Office actions per fiscal year , 175,500 ( 27 % ) issued small entities . 175,500 Office actions issued small entities , approximately 14 % , approximately 24,570 , contain least one nonstatutory double patenting rejection , approximately 4 % , approximately 7,020 , contain nonstatutory double patenting rejection ( ) . estimate potential impact small entities proposed rulemaking , USPTO refers 2023 Report Economic Survey , published Committee Economics Legal Practice American Intellectual Property Law Association , estimates median cost $ 3,500 per Office action response.1 purposes certification , USPTO estimates approximately 20 % small entity applicants patent owners USPTO estimates choose file terminal disclaimer proposed agreement opt argue and/or amend claims obviate nonstatutory double patenting rejection ( ) . USPTO therefore estimates proposed rulemaking could potential annual cost small entities $ 17,199,000 ( 24,570 × 20 % × $ 3,500 ) responding Office action containing least one nonstatutory double patenting rejection arguing and/or amending claims , rather filing terminal disclaimer . Furthermore , USPTO estimates , upper range , approximately 50 % , approximately 2,457 ( 24,570 × 20 % × 50 % ) , responses filed fail obviate least one nonstatutory double patenting rejection . cases may potentially incur additional cost small entities $ 8,599,500 ( 2,457 × $ 3,500 ) respond additional Office action . Therefore , USPTO estimates upper range cost proposed rulemaking could approximately 20 % potentially impacted small entities $ 25,798,500 ( $ 17,199,000 + $ 8,599,500 ) . estimated cost therefore affect substantial number ( approximately 20 % ) small entities . least two reasons , USPTO believes estimates represent upper range potential impact small entities . First , preceding estimates account cost savings , including filing fee savings , filing terminal disclaimer . USPTO charges fee $ 170 filing terminal disclaimer . Based estimated 4,914 small entity applicants opt file terminal disclaimer , USPTO estimates terminal disclaimer filing fee savings $ 835,380 . addition , USPTO estimates takes estimated 0.25 hours ( 15 minutes ) applicants patent owners file terminal disclaimer . 2023 Report Economic Survey estimates hourly attorney fee $ 447 . Based estimated 4,914 small entity applicants opt file terminal disclaimer , USPTO estimates cost savings $ 549,140 . Therefore , total cost savings filing terminal disclaimer proposed rulemaking $ 1,384,520 . Second , preceding cost estimates based Office actions containing least one nonstatutory double patenting rejection , including Office actions containing least one rejection nonstatutory double patenting rejection . stated , USPTO estimates 7,020 Office actions contain nonstatutory double patenting rejection ( ) . Thus , 17,550 ( 24,570¥7,020 ) Office actions , small entity applicants patent owners would respond least one rejection nonstatutory double patenting rejection . therefore follows least portions annual costs preceding estimates 17,550 Office actions excluded would attributed responding rejection ( ) . Thus , total upper range estimated cost 24,570 small entity applicants patent owners impacted rule would $ 24,413,980 ( $ 25,798,500¥ $ 1,384,520 ) . USPTO data determine distribution cost across 24,570 small entity applicants patent owners would impacted rule . Thus , purposes certification , USPTO estimates average less $ 1,000 impact 24,570 small entities . However , mentioned , estimate likely overstated impact would attributed costs related responding rejection nonstatutory double patenting rejection . foregoing reasons , changes proposed rulemaking significant economic impact substantial number small entities .

E. Executive Order 13132 ( Federalism ) rulemaking pertains strictly Federal agency procedures contain policies federalism implications sufficient warrant preparation Federalism Assessment Executive Order 13132 ( August 4 , 1999 ) . F. Executive Order 13175 ( Tribal Consultation ) rulemaking : ( 1 ) substantial direct effects one Indian Tribes ; ( 2 ) impose substantial direct compliance costs Indian Tribal governments ; ( 3 ) preempt Tribal law . Therefore , Tribal summary impact statement required Executive Order 13175 ( November 6 , 2000 ) . G. Executive Order 13211 ( Energy Effects ) rulemaking significant energy action Executive Order 13211 rulemaking likely significant adverse effect supply , distribution , use energy . Therefore , Statement Energy Effects required Executive Order 13211 ( May 18 , 2001 ) . H. Executive Order 12988 ( Civil Justice Reform ) rulemaking meets applicable standards minimize litigation , eliminate ambiguity , reduce burden set forth sections 3 ( ) 3 ( b ) ( 2 ) Executive Order 12988 ( February 5 , 1996 ) . . Executive Order 13045 ( Protection Children ) rulemaking concern environmental risk health safety may disproportionately affect children Executive Order 13045 ( April 21 , 1997 ) . J .

Therefore , rulemaking expected result ‘ ‘ major rule ’ ’ defined 5 U.S.C . 804 ( 2 ) . L. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 1995 changes proposed rulemaking involve Federal intergovernmental mandate result expenditure State , local , Tribal governments , aggregate , $ 100 million ( adjusted ) one year , Federal private sector mandate result expenditure private sector $ 100 million ( adjusted ) one year , significantly uniquely affect small governments . Therefore , actions necessary provisions Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 1995 . See 2 U.S.C . 1501 et seq . M.

National Technology Transfer Advancement Act 1995 requirements section 12 ( ) National Technology Transfer Advancement Act 1995 ( 15 U.S.C . 272 note ) applicable rulemaking contain provisions involve use technical standards . O. Paperwork Reduction Act 1995 Paperwork Reduction Act 1995 ( 44 U.S.C . 3501 et seq . ) ( PRA ) requires USPTO consider impact paperwork information collection burdens imposed public . rulemaking involves information collection requirements subject review approval Office Management Budget ( OMB ) Paperwork Reduction Act . proposed rulemaking impacts rules practice pertaining terminal disclaimers . general provisions pertaining terminal disclaimers reviewed approved OMB OMB control number 0651–0031 accounted line item Statutory Disclaimers ( including terminal disclaimers ) contained 0651–0031 . 60-day notice published January 29 , 2024 ( 89 FR 5500 ) , renewal 0651–0031 , USPTO provided estimates line item estimates appear . proposed rulemaking , USPTO proposes modify terminal disclaimers include additional agreement discussed preamble . USPTO estimates approximately 20 % applicants patent owners considering filing terminal disclaimer obviate nonstatutory double patenting opt file terminal disclaimer containing proposed agreement , least initial period effective date final rule . Therefore , USPTO proposed estimates take account anticipated 20 % reduction terminal disclaimer filings .
