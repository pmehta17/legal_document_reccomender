HHS noted , general , SUDs listed DSM–V defined inability cease drug use despite harmful consequences ; Cannabis Use Disorder ( ‘ ‘ CUD ’ ’ ) shares diagnostic criteria common SUDs drugs abuse . Estimates CUD individuals regularly use marijuana vary range 10 20 percent . estimates similar data United States National Comorbidity Study , showed 9 percent lifetime cannabis users met criteria dependence outlined DSM ’ revised Third Edition time life , compared 32 percent tobacco users , 23 percent opiate users , 15 percent alcohol users . National Epidemiologic Survey Alcohol Related Conditions also reported nine percent lifetime cumulative probability transitioning marijuana use dependence , higher risk dependence individuals history psychiatric substance dependence comorbidity . United States , data 2020 NSDUH show approximately 14 million individuals aged 12 older use marijuana cannabinoid preparations met criteria CUD , representing 5.1 percent individuals aged 12 older meeting NSDUH survey inclusion criteria . HHS Basis Rec . 58 . Individuals develop SUD , including CUD , may seek treatment . 2015 2020 , TEDS documented approximately 10.8 million treatment episode admissions reported individuals treated publicly funded substance use treatment programs . 1.4 million treatment admissions documented TEDS 2020 , marijuana reported primary substance abuse approximately 10 percent admissions , making third frequently reported primary substance abuse , alcohol ( 31.2 percent ) heroin ( 20.6 percent ) . similar pattern seen 2015 2019 .
