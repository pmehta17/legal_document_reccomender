See Tit . VII IRTPA . Section 7208 IRTPA ( 8 U.S.C . 1365b ) requires DHS implement biometric entry exit data system . Congress expressed IRTPA biometric entry-exit data system ‘ ‘ essential investment efforts protect United States preventing entry terrorists. ’ ’ Sec . 7208 ( ) IRTPA ( 8 U.S.C . 1365b ( ) ) . Moreover , IRTPA explicitly highlights certain goals DHS biometric entry-exit system addition serving vital counterterrorism mechanism , include efficiently screening travelers , integrating modifying relevant databases address increased volume usage , improving database search capacities .

B . Need Rulemaking DHS must interpret ambiguous statutory language implement responsibilities Congress assigned agency . language Public Law 114–113 establishing 9– 11 Biometric Fee ambiguous regarding fee ’ applicability extension-of-stay petitions . DHS must therefore resolve statutory ambiguity determine whether 9–11 Biometric Fee applies extensionof-stay petitions covered employers.15 discussed , Public Law 114–113 established 9–11 Biometric Fee enacting doubling 2010 Supplemental Fee $ 4,000 H–1B petitions $ 4,500 L–1 petitions . Congress also added new phrasing two pertinent places guided Department ’ proposed interpretation : ‘ ‘ . . . combined filing fee [ Fraud Fee ] required submitted application admission [ H–1B L nonimmigrant ] , including application extension status , shall increased. ’ ’ Sec . 402 ( g ) , Public Law 114–113 ( emphasis added ) . Previously , DHS determine whether 9–11 Biometric Fee applies extension petitions covered employers Fraud Fee also charged ( change employer petitions beneficiary already H–1B L–1 status , including change employer petition requests extension status ) . 2016 , DHS interpreted 9–11 Biometric Fee apply Fraud Fee also applied . 81 FR 73292 . 2019 , DHS considered applying 9–11 Biometric Fee extension petitions would significant new substantive expansion 9–11 Biometric Fee compared interpretation DHS adopted 2010–2015 2010 Supplemental Fee . time , DHS considered latter reading would consistent scope 2010 Supplemental Fee ( although higher amounts provided Pub .

Following passage Public Law 114–113 , DHS considered alternative interpretations ambiguous language , ultimately decided , time , maintain earlier interpretation , 9–11 Biometric Fee applies Fraud Fee applies . DHS internally noted alternative interpretations also reasonable chose maintain status quo time internally reviewing alternative interpretations . See 2019 Fee NRPM , 84 FR 62280 , 62322 .

Proposed Amendment Collection 9–11 Biometric Fees DHS proposes amend regulations 8 CFR 106.2 ( c ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) specify 9–11 Biometric Fee apply H–1B L–1 extension-of-stay petitions addition previously covered H–1B L– 1 petitions.23 Accordingly , DHS proposes replace phrase ‘ ‘ certain petitioners ’ ’ ‘ ‘ petitioners ’ ’ subparagraphs concerning H–1B L–1 petitioners . proposed change allow DHS charge covered petitioners 9–11 Biometric Fee , including seeking extension petitions involve change employer , opposed petitioners whose petitions also subject Fraud Fee . B . Proposed Clarifying Amendments DHS also proposes certain clarifying amendments . First , DHS proposes insert phrase ‘ ‘ except petitioners filing amended petition without extension stay request. ’ ’ Amended petitions filed notify USCIS material change terms conditions employment beneficiary ’ eligibility specified original approved petition . See USCIS , Form I–129 , Instructions Petition Nonimmigrant Worker , https : //www.uscis.gov/sites/default/ files/document/forms/i-129instr.pdf . proposed regulations , covered petitioners filing H–1B L– 1 amended petition include extension stay request would required submit 9– 11 Biometric Fee . DHS proposes clarify method determines whether petitioner covered employer . Currently , DHS counts full-time part-time employees hold H–1B L–1 status order determine whether employer meets definition ‘ ‘ covered employer ’ ’ reaching 50 percent threshold . DHS requires 9–11 Biometric Fee threshold met considered covered employer . DHS proposes adding words ‘ ‘ aggregate ’ ’ provisions 8 CFR 106.2 ( c ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) clarify current practice . V.
