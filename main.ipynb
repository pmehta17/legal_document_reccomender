Order No.\\n5931–2024]\\nSchedules of Controlled Substances:\\nRescheduling of Marijuana\\nAGENCY: Drug Enforcement\\nAdministration, Department of Justice.\\nACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.\\nSUMMARY: The Department of Justice\\n(‘‘DOJ’’) proposes to transfer marijuana\\nfrom schedule I of the Controlled\\nSubstances Act (‘‘CSA’’) to schedule III\\nof the CSA, consistent with the view of\\nthe Department of Health and Human\\nServices (‘‘HHS’’) that marijuana has a\\ncurrently accepted medical use as well\\nas HHS’s views about marijuana’s abuse\\npotential and level of physical or\\npsychological dependence. The CSA\\nrequires that such actions be made\\nthrough formal rulemaking on the\\nrecord after opportunity for a hearing. If\\nthe transfer to schedule III is finalized,\\nthe regulatory controls applicable to\\nschedule III controlled substances\\nwould apply, as appropriate, along with\\nexisting marijuana-specific\\nrequirements and any additional\\ncontrols that might be implemented,\\nincluding those that might be\\nimplemented to meet U.S. treaty\\nobligations. If marijuana is transferred\\ninto schedule III, the manufacture,\\ndistribution, dispensing, and possession\\nof marijuana would remain subject to\\nthe applicable criminal prohibitions of\\nthe CSA. Any drugs containing a\\nsubstance within the CSA’s definition of\\n‘‘marijuana’’ would also remain subject\\nto the applicable prohibitions in the\\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\\n(‘‘FDCA’’). DOJ is soliciting comments\\non this proposal.\\nDATES: Comments must be submitted\\nelectronically or postmarked on or\\nbefore July 22, 2024.

Request for Hearing, Notice of\\nAppearance at, or Waiver of\\nParticipation in Hearing\\nPursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a), this\\nscheduling action is a formal\\nrulemaking ‘‘on the record after\\nopportunity for a hearing.’’ Such\\nproceedings are conducted pursuant to\\nthe Administrative Procedure Act\\n(‘‘APA’’), 5 U.S.C. 551–559. See 21 CFR\\n1308.41 through 1308.45; id part 1316,\\nsubpart D. Interested persons, as defined\\nin 21 CFR 1300.01(b), may file requests\\nfor a hearing in conformity with the\\nrequirements of 21 CFR 1308.44(a) and\\n1316.47(a), and such requests must:\\n(1) state with particularity the interest\\nof the person in the proceeding;\\n(2) state with particularity the\\nobjections or issues concerning which\\nthe person desires to be heard; and\\n(3) state briefly the position of the\\nperson regarding the objections or\\nissues.\\nAll requests for a hearing and waivers\\nof an opportunity for a hearing or\\nparticipation, together with a written\\nstatement of position on the matters of\\nfact and law involved in such hearing,\\nmust be sent to DEA using the address\\ninformation provided above.\\nThe decision whether an in-person\\nhearing will be needed to address such\\nmatters of fact and law in the\\nrulemaking will be made by the\\nAdministrator of DEA. Upon the\\nAdministrator’s determination to grant\\nan in-person hearing, DEA will publish\\na notice of hearing on the proposed\\nrulemaking in the Federal Register. See\\n21 CFR 1308.44(b), 1316.53.\\nIf the Administrator determines to\\ngrant an in-person hearing to address\\nsuch matters of fact and law in this\\nrulemaking, the Administrator will then\\ndesignate an Administrative Law Judge\\n(‘‘ALJ’’) to preside over the hearing. The\\nALJ’s functions shall commence upon\\ndesignation, as provided in 21 CFR\\n1316.52. The ALJ will have all powers\\nnecessary to conduct a fair hearing, to\\ntake all necessary action to avoid delay,\\nand to maintain order. Id. The ALJ’s\\nauthorities include the power to hold\\nconferences to simplify or determine the\\nissues in the hearing or to consider\\nother matters that may aid in the\\nexpeditious disposition of the hearing;\\nrequire parties to state their position in\\nwriting; sign and issue subpoenas to\\ncompel the production of documents\\nand materials to the extent necessary to\\nconduct the hearing; examine witnesses\\nand direct witnesses to testify; receive,\\nrule on, exclude, or limit evidence; rule\\non procedural items; and take any\\naction permitted by the presiding officer\\nunder DEA’s hearing procedures and the\\nAPA. Id.\\nComments on or objections to the\\nproposed rule submitted under 21 CFR\\n1308.43(g) will be offered as evidence at\\nthe hearing, but the presiding officer\\nshall admit only evidence that is\\ncompetent, relevant, material, and not\\nunduly repetitive. 21 CFR 1316.59(a).\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 16:01 May 20, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\\\\FR\\\\FM\\\\21MYP1.SGM 21MYP1\\nddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PROPOSALS1\\nFederal Register / Vol. 89, No. 99 / Tuesday, May 21, 2024 / Proposed Rules 44599\\n1OLC’s opinion is available in its entirety under\\n‘‘Supporting and Related Material’’ of the public\\ndocket for this proposed rule at https://\\nwww.regulations.gov under docket number DEA–\\n1362.\\n2The CSA’s reliance on formal rulemaking for\\nscheduling decisions indicates that HHS’s\\ndeterminations do not bind DOJ for the entirety of\\nthe rulemaking process, because outside\\nparticipants may submit additional scientific and\\nmedical evidence during the rulemaking that DOJ\\nwould need to consider. OLC Op. at *25. However,\\nDOJ ‘‘may not simply cast aside HHS’s scientific\\nand medical recommendations once it initiates\\nrulemaking proceedings by issuing an NPRM,’’\\nsince ‘‘[t]he categorical use of the word ‘binding’ in\\nsection 811(b) suggests that Congress intended\\nHHS’s scientific and medical views to at least be a\\nvery significant input in the scheduling process,’’\\nand the legislative history of the CSA bolsters that\\nconclusion. Id. at 25–26 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 91–\\n1444, at 22–23 (1970)).\\nAny interested person may file a\\nwaiver of opportunity for a hearing or to\\nparticipate in a hearing in conformity\\nwith the requirements of 21 CFR\\n1308.44(c), together with a written\\nstatement of position on the matters of\\nfact and law involved in any hearing. 21\\nCFR 1316.49. Such statement, if\\nadmissible, will be included in the\\nrecord and considered as described in\\n21 CFR 1308.44(c).\\nIn accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811 and\\n812, the purpose of a hearing would be\\nto ‘‘receiv[e] factual evidence and expert\\nopinion regarding’’ whether marijuana\\nshould be transferred to schedule III of\\nthe list of controlled substances. 21 CFR\\n1308.42. Concurrent with this\\nrulemaking, DEA will consider the\\nmarijuana-specific controls that would\\nbe necessary to comply with relevant\\ntreaty obligations in the event that, after\\nthe hearing, a final order reschedules\\nmarijuana, and, to the extent such\\ncontrols are needed if marijuana is\\nrescheduled, will seek to finalize any\\nsuch regulations as soon as possible.\\nAll requests for hearing and waivers\\nof an opportunity for a hearing or\\nparticipation must be sent to DEA using\\nthe address information above, on or\\nbefore the date specified above.\\nIII. Legal Authority\\nUnder the CSA, 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.,\\nthe Attorney General shall, before\\ninitiating proceedings to control,\\ndecontrol, or transfer between schedules\\na drug or other substance, request from\\nthe Secretary of HHS a scientific and\\nmedical evaluation, and the Secretary’s\\nrecommendations, as to whether such\\ndrug or other substance should be so\\ncontrolled or removed as a controlled\\nsubstance. 21 U.S.C. 811(b). The\\nrecommendations of the Secretary shall\\ninclude recommendations with respect\\nto the appropriate schedule, if any,\\nunder which such drug or other\\nsubstance should be listed. Id.\\nHHS recommended in August 2023\\nthat marijuana be rescheduled to\\nschedule III. See Letter for Anne\\nMilgram, Administrator, DEA, from\\nRachel L. Levine, M.D., Assistant\\nSecretary for Health, HHS (Aug. 29,\\n2023) (‘‘August 2023 Letter’’). The\\nAttorney General then sought the legal\\nadvice of the Office of Legal Counsel\\n(‘‘OLC’’) at DOJ on questions relevant to\\nthis rulemaking proceeding. Among\\nother conclusions, OLC concluded that\\n‘‘HHS’s scientific and medical\\ndeterminations must be binding until\\nissuance of a notice of proposed\\nrulemaking [(‘NPRM’)].’’ Questions\\nRelated to the Potential Rescheduling of\\nMarijuana, 45 Op. O.L.C. ll, at *25\\n(Apr. 11, 2024) (‘‘OLC Op.’’).1 After the\\nissuance of a notice of rulemaking\\nproceedings, HHS’s scientific and\\nmedical determinations are accorded\\n‘‘significant deference’’ through the rest\\nof the rulemaking process.2 OLC Op. at\\n*26.\\nUnder the CSA, when recommending\\nor determining that a drug should be\\ncontrolled (and if so, under which\\nschedule), the Secretary and the\\nAttorney General must consider eight\\nfactors set forth in 21 U.S.C. 811(c). The\\neight factors are:\\n1. The drug’s actual or relative\\npotential for abuse;\\n2. Scientific evidence of its\\npharmacological effect, if known;\\n3. The state of current scientific\\nknowledge regarding the drug or other\\nsubstance;\\n4. Its history and current pattern of\\nabuse;\\n5. The scope, duration, and\\nsignificance of abuse;\\n6. What, if any, risk there is to the\\npublic health;\\n7. Its psychic or physiological\\ndependence liability; and\\n8. Whether the substance is an\\nimmediate precursor of a substance\\nalready controlled.\\n21 U.S.C. 811(c); see also id. 811(b)\\n(specifying how HHS should consider\\neach of the eight factors).\\nThe United States is a party to the\\n1961 United Nations Single Convention\\non Narcotic Drugs, March 30, 1961, 18\\nU.S.T. 1407, 520 U.N.T.S. 151 (‘‘Single\\nConvention’’), as amended by the 1972\\nProtocol, March 25, 1972, 26 U.S.T.\\n1439, 976 U.N.T.S. 3. Under 21 U.S.C.\\n811(d)(1), if control of a substance is\\nrequired ‘‘by United States obligations\\nunder international treaties,\\nconventions, or protocols in effect on\\nOctober 27, 1970,’’ the Attorney General\\nmust issue an order controlling such\\ndrug ‘‘under the schedule he deems\\nmost appropriate to carry out such\\nobligations, without regard to the\\nfindings’’ required by 21 U.S.C. 811(a)\\nor 812(b), ‘‘and without regard to the\\nprocedures’’ prescribed by 21 U.S.C.\\n811(a) and (b). Marijuana is a drug\\ncovered by the Single Convention. See\\nSingle Convention art. 1(1)(b); OLC Op.\\nat *26 & n.7.\\nOLC and the United States Court of\\nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit have\\nexplained that section 811(d)(1) does\\nnot supersede the scheduling\\nprocedures set forth in sections 811(a)\\nthrough (b) and 812(b), including the\\nrequirement to consider the eight factors\\nset forth in section 811(c). Instead,\\nsection 811(d)(1) allows the Attorney\\nGeneral to ‘‘identify which schedules\\nwould satisfy the United States’\\ninternational obligations with respect to\\na particular drug, and then—if more\\nthan one schedule would do so—select\\nwhich schedule to use through the\\nsection 811(a) through (b) and 812(b)\\nprocedures.’’ OLC Op. at *29 n.8; accord\\nNat’l Org. for Reform of Marijuana Laws\\n(NORML II) v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735, 747\\n(D.C. Cir. 1977). HHS performed the\\neight-factor analysis. See Memorandum\\nfor DEA, from HHS, Re: Basis for the\\nRecommendation to Reschedule\\nMarijuana to Schedule III of the\\nControlled Substances Act (‘‘HHS Basis\\nfor Rec.’’). As noted above, HHS’s\\nscientific and medical determinations\\nare binding on DOJ until an NPRM is\\npublished, and, in addition, DOJ must\\naccord ‘‘significant deference’’ to HHS’s\\nscientific and medical determinations\\nthroughout the rulemaking process. OLC\\nOp. at *25–26.\\nOnce the determination is made that\\na particular drug or substance must be\\ncontrolled under the CSA, the Attorney\\nGeneral must determine the level of\\ncontrol over the drug or substance under\\nthe CSA. See 21 U.S.C. 811(a), (b). The\\nCSA divides controlled substances into\\nfive levels of control, or ‘‘schedules,’’\\nbased on (1) a drug’s potential for abuse,\\n(2) whether the drug has a currently\\naccepted medical use in treatment in the\\nUnited States (‘‘CAMU’’), and (3)\\nwhether there is a lack of accepted\\nsafety for use of the drug under medical\\nsupervision or the level of psychological\\nor physical dependence that could\\nresult from abuse of the drug. See id.\\n812(b). Schedule I drugs have a high\\npotential for abuse, no CAMU, and a\\nlack of accepted safety for use under\\nmedical supervision. Id. 812(b)(1).\\nSchedule II drugs also have a high\\npotential for abuse but have a CAMU (or\\na CAMU with ‘‘severe restrictions’’), and\\nabuse of the drug may lead to severe\\npsychological or physical dependence.\\nId. 812(b)(2).

Id.\\nIV. Background\\nWhen Congress enacted the CSA in\\n1970, it placed marijuana in schedule I.\\nComprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention\\nand Control Act of 1970, Public Law 91–\\n513, tit. II, sec. 202(c), 84 Stat. 1236,\\n1249 (1970); 21 U.S.C. 812(c).4 The\\nAttorney General is authorized to\\namend this initial placement. 21 U.S.C.\\n812(c); see also id. 811, 812(b). Other\\nschedule I substances include heroin,\\nlysergic acid diethylamide (commonly\\nknown as LSD), and 3,4-methylene\\ndioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy). See\\n21 CFR 1308.11. Drugs controlled under\\nschedule II include cocaine,\\nmethamphetamine, methadone,\\noxycodone, and fentanyl. Id. § 1308.12.\\nDrugs controlled under schedule III\\ninclude products containing less than\\n90 milligrams of codeine per dosage\\nunit, ketamine, and anabolic steroids.\\nId. § 1308.13. Petitioners have requested\\nthat marijuana be rescheduled several\\ntimes over the years. See, e.g., Schedule\\nof Controlled Substances: Petition To\\nRemove Marihuana From Control or in\\nthe Alternative To Control Marihuana in\\nSchedule V of the Controlled\\nSubstances Act, 37 FR 18097 (Sept. 7,\\n1972); Notice of Denial of Petition, 66\\nFR 20038 (Apr. 18, 2001); Denial of\\nPetition To Initiate Proceedings To\\nReschedule Marijuana, 76 FR 40552\\n(July 8, 2011).\\nDEA and HHS last examined the issue\\nof whether to reschedule marijuana\\neight years ago, in 2016, when DEA\\ndenied two petitions to reschedule\\nmarijuana.5 At the time, HHS concurred\\nthat marijuana should remain a\\nschedule I drug because it met the three\\ncriteria for placement in schedule I. 81\\nFR 53706–07. In accordance with the\\nrequirements for placement in schedule\\nI, HHS found that: (1) marijuana had a\\nhigh potential for abuse; (2) it did not\\nhave a CAMU; and (3) there was a lack\\nof accepted safety for use of marijuana\\nunder medical supervision. Id. As\\ndiscussed in detail below, in 2023, HHS\\nconducted a scientific and medical\\nevaluation of marijuana based on a\\ncomprehensive review of available data\\nat that time and recommended that\\nmarijuana be transferred to schedule III.\\nSince 1996, 38 States, the District of\\nColumbia, and 4 Federal Territories\\nhave legalized the use of medical\\nmarijuana. HHS Basis for Rec. at 30;\\nOLC Op at *9. These laws typically\\nallow the cultivation, sale, and use of\\nmarijuana by patients (or their\\ncaregivers) whose health care\\npractitioners have recommended that\\nthey use marijuana to treat certain\\nhealth conditions. See, e.g., Ohio Rev.\\nCode secs. 3796.01(A)(6)(a)–(v),\\n3796.01(A); N.Y. Cannabis Law secs.\\n3(18), 30, 31; N.M. Stat. secs. 26–2B–\\n3(F)(1)–(23), 26–2B–3(N), 26–2B–4(A).\\nFurther, beginning in Fiscal Year 2015,\\nCongress has adopted an appropriations\\nrider every year that prohibits DOJ from\\nusing funds to prevent certain States,\\nTerritories, and the District of Columbia\\nfrom implementing their own laws with\\nrespect to medical marijuana. E.g.,\\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2024,\\nPublic Law 118–42, sec. 531, 138 Stat.\\n25; Consolidated Appropriations Act,\\n2023, Public Law 117–328, sec. 531, 136\\nStat. 4459, 4561 (2022); see also Cong.\\nResearch Serv., R44782, The Evolution\\nof Marijuana as a Controlled Substance\\nand the Federal-State Policy Gap 26 &\\nn.159 (updated Apr. 7, 2022) (collecting\\nadditional appropriations riders).\\nMarijuana is generally defined by\\nstatute to mean ‘‘the plant Cannabis\\nsativa L., whether growing or not; the\\nseeds thereof; the resin extracted from\\nany part of such plant; and every\\ncompound, manufacture, salt,\\nderivative, mixture, or preparation of\\nsuch plant, its seeds or resin.’’ 21 U.S.C.\\n802(16)(A). In 2018, Congress amended\\nthe CSA to remove ‘‘(i) hemp, as defined\\nin section [1639o of title 7 of the U.S.\\nCode]’’ from the definition of\\nmarijuana.6 Agricultural Improvement\\nAct of 2018, Public Law 115–334, sec.\\n12619, 132 Stat. 4490, 5018. Section\\n1639o(1) of title 7 in turn defines hemp\\nas ‘‘the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any\\npart of that plant, including the seeds\\nthereof and all derivatives, extracts,\\ncannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and\\nsalts of isomers, whether growing or not,\\nwith a delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\\nconcentration of not more than 0.3\\npercent on a dry weight basis.’’ Delta-9-\\ntetrahydrocannabinol (‘‘D9-THC’’) is the\\nmajor psychoactive intoxicating\\ncannabinoid in marijuana. See HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 10.

Proposal To Reschedule Marijuana\\nThe CSA vests the Attorney General\\nwith the authority to schedule,\\nreschedule, or decontrol drugs. 21\\nU.S.C. 811(a). The Attorney General has\\ndelegated that authority to the DEA\\nAdministrator, see 28 CFR 0.100, but\\nalso retains the authority to schedule\\ndrugs under the CSA in the first\\ninstance, see 28 U.S.C. 509, 510. The\\nHHS Assistant Secretary for Health has\\nprovided a recommendation for\\ntransferring marijuana to schedule III.

Eight-Factor Analysis\\nDOJ has reviewed the scientific and\\nmedical evaluation and scheduling\\nrecommendation provided by HHS and\\nhas conducted a separate review of the\\neight factors identified in 21 U.S.C.\\n811(c). At this point in the proceedings,\\nDOJ must treat HHS’s scientific and\\nmedical determinations as binding. See\\nOLC Op. at *4, *25. HHS’s scientific and\\nmedical determinations are included\\nbelow, as well as certain information\\nfrom DEA.\\n1. Marijuana’s Actual or Relative\\nPotential for Abuse\\nThe first factor that DOJ and HHS\\nmust consider under 21 U.S.C. 811(c) is\\nthe actual or relative potential for abuse\\nof marijuana. The term ‘‘abuse’’ is not\\ndefined in the CSA. However, consistent\\nwith the legislative history of the CSA,\\nDEA and HHS have typically weighed\\nthe following factors in determining\\nwhether a particular drug or substance\\nhas a potential for abuse: 8\\nA. Whether there is evidence that\\nindividuals are taking the drug or drugs\\ncontaining such a substance in amounts\\nsufficient to create a hazard to their\\nhealth or to the safety of other\\nindividuals or to the community.\\nAs part of its analysis, HHS\\nconcluded that evidence shows that,\\nalthough some individuals are taking\\nmarijuana in amounts sufficient to\\ncreate a hazard to their health and to the\\nsafety of other individuals and the\\ncommunity, the vast majority of\\nindividuals who use marijuana are\\ndoing so in a manner that does not lead\\nto dangerous outcomes to themselves or\\nothers. HHS Basis for Rec. at 6–7. The\\ndata supportive of this conclusion are\\ndiscussed in detail in HHS’s analysis of\\nFactors 4, 5, and 6. See HHS Basis for\\nRec. at 28–57.\\nIn particular, HHS emphasized that an\\nevaluation of various epidemiological\\ndatabases of adverse outcomes from\\n2015 to 2021 involving marijuana or\\ncomparator drugs that are used\\nnonmedically showed that the\\nutilization-adjusted rate of adverse\\noutcomes involving marijuana was\\nconsistently lower than the utilizationadjusted rates of adverse outcomes\\ninvolving heroin, cocaine, and, for\\ncertain outcomes, other comparators,\\nincluding alcohol. Also, alcohol or\\nheroin typically ranked first or in\\nimmediately subsequent positions\\namong the comparators in terms of\\nincidence of adverse outcomes, with\\nmarijuana in a lower place in that\\nranking. This pattern also was observed\\nfor serious medical outcomes, including\\ndeath, observed in Poison Center data,\\nwhere marijuana was in the lowest\\nranking group. This suggests\\nconsistency across databases, across\\ndrugs, and over time. HHS thus\\nconcluded that although abuse of\\nmarijuana produces clear evidence of\\nharmful consequences, these appear to\\nbe relatively less common and less\\nsevere than the consequences of some\\nother comparator substances. HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 7–8.\\nImportantly, these comparisons of the\\nprevalence of adverse outcomes were\\nfrom descriptive analyses only,\\nfollowing the established practice in\\nprevious eight-factor analyses. Thus,\\ndifferences in outcome frequency and\\nseverity, and the ranked order across\\ncomparators, may be attributable in part\\nto underlying differences in the\\npopulations being compared (e.g., age or\\npre-existing medical conditions), among\\nother things. Despite these limitations,\\nqualitative synthesis of descriptive\\nanalyses is the established practice in\\nprevious eight-factor analyses, and HHS\\ndetermined that it is the most\\nappropriate approach here. HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 7–8.\\nHHS also concluded that the publichealth risks posed by marijuana are\\nlower compared to those posed by other\\ndrugs of abuse (e.g., heroin, oxycodone,\\ncocaine), based on HHS’s evaluation of\\nvarious epidemiological databases for\\nemergency department (‘‘ED’’) visits,\\nhospitalizations, unintentional\\nexposures, and most importantly,\\noverdose deaths. The rank order of the\\ncomparators in terms of greatest adverse\\nconsequences typically ranked heroin,\\nbenzodiazepines, and cocaine first or in\\nimmediately subsequent positions, with\\nmarijuana in a lower place in the\\nranking, especially when HHS adjusted\\nfor utilization. For overdose deaths,\\nmarijuana is always in the lowest\\nranking among comparator drugs. These\\nevaluations demonstrate that there is\\nconsistency across databases, across\\nsubstances, and over time. HHS thus\\nconcluded that although abuse of\\nmarijuana produces clear evidence of a\\nrisk to public health, that risk is\\nrelatively lower than that posed by most\\nother comparator drugs.

Whether individuals are taking the\\ndrug or drugs containing such a\\nsubstance on their own initiative rather\\nthan on the basis of medical advice from\\na practitioner licensed by law to\\nadminister such drugs in the course of\\ntheir professional practice.\\nAs HHS notes, the Food and Drug\\nAdministration (‘‘FDA’’) has not\\napproved a New Drug Application\\n(‘‘NDA’’) for a drug product containing\\nbotanical marijuana for any therapeutic\\nindication. Thus, the only way an\\nindividual can use marijuana on the\\nbasis of medical advice through\\nlegitimate channels under Federal law is\\nby participating in research under an\\nIND. However, 38 States and the District\\nof Columbia have enacted laws allowing\\nindividuals to use marijuana under\\ncertain circumstances for medical\\npurposes. Outside of the Federal- and\\nState-sanctioned medical use of\\nmarijuana, individuals are using\\nmarijuana on their own initiative for\\nmedical, as well as nonmedical,\\npurposes.

Whether the drug or drugs\\ncontaining such a substance are new\\ndrugs so related in their action to a drug\\nor drugs already listed as having a\\npotential for abuse to make it likely that\\nit will have the same potentiality for\\nabuse as such drugs, thus making it\\nreasonable to assume that there may be\\nsignificant diversions from legitimate\\nchannels, significant use contrary to or\\nwithout medical advice, or that they\\nhave a substantial capability of creating\\nhazards to the health of the user or to\\nthe safety of the community.\\nMarijuana has been a schedule I\\nsubstance since the CSA was enacted in\\n1970. See Public Law 91–513, tit. II, sec.\\n202(c), 84 Stat. 1236, 1249 (1970); 21\\nU.S.C. 812(c); see also 21 CFR\\n1308.11(d)(23). The primary compound\\nin marijuana that is responsible for its\\nabuse potential is D9-THC (also known\\nas dronabinol, when specifically\\nreferring to the (-)-trans-D9-THC\\nstereoisomer), which has agonist\\nactivity at cannabinoid CB1 receptors.\\nHHS found that there are extensive\\nnonclinical and clinical studies\\nestablishing that marijuana, due to the\\nCB1 agonist activity of its main\\ncannabinoid constituent D9-THC,\\nproduces rewarding effects that would\\nbe consistent with observed long-term\\npatterns of nonmedical use and abuse,\\nboth before and in the years since\\nenactment of the CSA.

Syndros, a drug product\\nalso containing dronabinol but\\nformulated in an oral solution, was\\napproved by FDA in 2016 for the\\ntreatment of anorexia associated with\\nweight loss in patients with AIDS, as\\nwell as nausea and vomiting associated\\nwith cancer chemotherapy in patients\\nwho failed to respond adequately to\\nconventional anti-emetic treatments. In\\n2017, DEA rescheduled ‘‘FDA-approved\\nproducts containing dronabinol in an\\noral solution’’ from schedule I into\\nschedule II. HHS Basis for Rec. at 4.\\nWhen Marinol and Syndros were\\nbeing developed, they underwent a\\nsystematic evaluation of their abuse\\npotential based on animal and human\\nbehavioral studies, which showed that\\ndronabinol has abuse potential. The\\nabuse-related studies confirmed the\\nabuse potential of D9-THC. HHS has\\nconcluded that these findings suggest\\nthat marijuana will continue to be used\\nnonmedically, diverted from legitimate\\nchannels, and trafficked in illicit\\nchannels as a potential source for\\ncontinued nonmedical use in the United\\nStates. HHS Basis for Rec. at 9; see also\\nHHS Basis for Rec. at 37–45 (Factor 5).\\nHHS Conclusion With Respect to\\nFactor 1\\nHHS determined that epidemiological\\ndata indicate that marijuana has the\\npotential for creating hazards to the\\nhealth of the user and to the safety of\\nthe community. However, as a relative\\nfinding on abuse liability, when\\ncomparing marijuana to heroin,\\noxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl,\\ncocaine, ketamine, benzodiazepines,\\nzolpidem, tramadol, and alcohol in\\nvarious epidemiological databases that\\nallow for some or all of these\\ncomparisons, marijuana is not typically\\namong the substances producing the\\nmost frequent incidence of adverse\\noutcomes or severity of substance use\\ndisorder. HHS Basis for Rec. at 9; see\\nalso HHS Basis for Rec. at 28–57\\n(Factors 4, 5, and 6). But as noted above,\\nthere are limitations in comparing\\ndescriptive data on adverse outcomes\\nacross drugs, although descriptive\\nanalyses of epidemiologic data are an\\nestablished practice in previous eightfactor analyses. HHS Basis for Rec. at 9.\\nIn 2016, DEA found that ‘‘[m]arijuana\\nhas a high potential for abuse.\\nPreclinical and clinical data show that\\nit has reinforcing effects characteristic of\\ndrugs of abuse. . . . Data on marijuana\\nseizures show widespread availability\\nand trafficking.’’ 81 FR 53739. DEA\\nbelieves that additional data in this area\\nmay be appropriate for consideration in\\nassessing marijuana’s actual or relative\\npotential for abuse.\\n2. Scientific Evidence of Marijuana’s\\nPharmacological Effects, If Known\\nThe second factor that DOJ and HHS\\nmust consider under 21 U.S.C. 811(c) is\\nthe scientific evidence of marijuana’s\\npharmacological effects, if known. In\\nmaking its recommendation, HHS\\nconsidered the scientific evidence of the\\npharmacological effects of marijuana\\nbased on the effects of D9-THC. HHS\\nconducted a scientific evaluation of the\\nneurochemistry, receptor pharmacology,\\nanimal abuse-related behavioral effects,\\nand human behavioral and\\nphysiological effects of marijuana. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 9.\\nA. Neurochemistry and Receptor\\nPharmacology of Marijuana\\nCannabis is the genus of a plant that\\ncontains numerous natural constituents,\\nincluding cannabinoids. See HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 18–21 (discussing Factor 3).\\nBecause cultivated chemovars may vary\\nin their composition and concentration\\nof various chemical constituents,\\nincluding with respect to whether they\\ncontain significant amounts of D9-THC\\nor other cannabinoids, marijuana\\nproducts from different strains will have\\ndiffering biological and pharmacological\\nprofiles. HHS Basis for Rec. at 10.\\nMarijuana contains at least 560\\nidentified natural constituents,\\nincluding 125 compounds classified as\\ncannabinoids. Most major cannabinoid\\ncompounds occurring naturally in\\ncannabis have been identified\\nchemically, but new and minor\\ncompounds are continuously being\\ncharacterized. HHS Basis for Rec. at 10.\\nThe two most abundant cannabinoids\\npresent in marijuana are D9-THC and\\nCBD. D9-THC is the major psychoactive\\nintoxicating cannabinoid in marijuana\\nand is the component of marijuana that\\nis primarily responsible for its abuse\\npotential. In contrast, CBD has\\nnegligible abuse potential, as assessed\\nby FDA during the NDA review for\\nEpidiolex, an FDA-approved drug\\nproduct containing plant derived,\\nhighly purified CBD. HHS Basis for Rec.\\nat 10.\\nThere are two cannabinoid receptors:\\nCB1 and CB2. CB1 and CB2 receptors\\nbelong to the family of G-proteincoupled receptors and present a typical\\nseven transmembrane-spanning domain\\nstructure. Cannabinoid receptors\\nprimarily link to an inhibitory G protein\\n(Gi/o), such that adenylate cyclase\\nactivity is inhibited when a cannabinoid\\nligand binds to the receptor. This, in\\nturn, prevents the conversion of\\nadenosine triphosphate to the second\\nmessenger, cyclic AMP (‘‘cAMP’’),\\nwhich decreases cAMP levels. As HHS’s\\nanalysis described, G proteins also\\ncontain beta/gamma G protein units that\\nare also liberated following ligand\\nbinding, which then bind to and alter\\nion channel function, including\\ninhibition of voltage-gated ion channels\\nand activation of potassium channels.\\nLigand binding can also activate some\\nsubforms of phospholipase C as well as\\nbeta-arrestin protein. All of these second\\nmessenger routes amplify the neural\\nsignal following cannabinoid binding at\\nthe CB1 and CB2 receptors. HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 10.\\nCB1 receptors are found primarily in\\nthe central nervous system (‘‘CNS’’), but\\nare also present in peripheral tissues,\\nsuch as the liver, heart, and lungs. In the\\nbrain, CB1 receptors are expressed with\\nhighest density in the cortical regions,\\nhippocampus, basal ganglia, and\\ncerebellum and with lowest density in\\nbrainstem and hypothalamic areas. The\\nlocalization of these receptors may\\nexplain cannabinoid effects on\\nmovement coordination, memory, and\\ncognition. Additionally, CB1 receptors\\nare found in glial cells as well as in the\\nimmune system. However, the\\nconcentration of CB1 receptors is\\nconsiderably lower in peripheral tissues\\nthan in the CNS. CB2 receptors are\\nfound primarily in the immune system,\\nincluding in numerous leukocyte cell\\ntypes, as well as in activated CNS\\nmicroglia. Additionally, there is some\\nevidence that CB2 receptors are\\nlocalized in the brain, primarily in the\\ncerebellum and hippocampus. The\\ndistribution of CB2 receptors throughout\\nthe body is less extensive than the\\ndistribution of CB1 receptors. HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 10–11.\\nThere are two endogenous\\ncannabinoid receptor agonists:\\nanandamide and arachidonyl glycerol\\n(‘‘2–AG’’). At CB1 receptors,\\nanandamide is a partial agonist with\\nlow intrinsic efficacy while 2–AG is a\\nfull agonist with high intrinsic efficacy.\\nThese endogenous cannabinoid ligands\\nare present in central as well as\\nperipheral tissues. A combination of\\nuptake and hydrolysis terminates the\\naction of anandamide and 2–AG. The\\nendogenous cannabinoid system is a\\nlocally active signaling system activated\\non demand in response to changes to\\nthe local conditions to help restore\\nhomeostasis.

This plasticity is particularly\\nevident in the CNS. HHS Basis for Rec.\\nat 11.\\nD9-THC and CBD have varying\\naffinity and effects at the cannabinoid\\nreceptors. HHS determined that D9-THC\\nis a partial agonist at both CB1 (Ki = 18–\\n218 nM) and CB2 receptors (Ki = 36–309\\nnM). However, CB1 receptors are the\\nmain pharmacological site of action for\\nD9-THC, making CB1 receptors the site\\nthat is responsible for the abuse\\npotential of marijuana. The other CNS\\nsite where D9-THC may have activity is\\nthe 5HT3 receptor, where it functions as\\nan antagonist. In contrast, CBD has low\\naffinity for both CB1 and CB2 receptors\\nand may act as a negative allosteric\\nmodulator or weak antagonist at these\\nsites. CBD has additional CNS effects as\\na serotonin 5HT1A agonist and a\\nserotonin 5HT2A weak partial agonist, as\\nwell as a serotonin 5HT3A antagonist.\\nHHS Basis for Rec. at 11.\\nIn the past 30 years, the potency of\\nmarijuana with regard to D9-THC has\\nincreased dramatically. HHS described\\none study finding that the concentration\\nof D9-THC in marijuana samples in the\\nUnited States increased from 3 percent\\nin 1991 to 17.1 percent in 2017. These\\nincreases are likely due to an increase\\nin the number of high potency samples\\n(i.e., sinsemilla) in the overall samples\\ntested. Based on an evaluation of\\nmarijuana seized by DEA, the majority\\nof samples contained high\\nconcentrations of D9-THC and low\\nconcentrations of CBD. HHS Basis for\\nRec. at 11–12.\\nB. Animal Abuse-Related Behavioral\\nEffects\\nSelf-Administration\\nSelf-administration is a method that\\nassesses the ability of a drug to produce\\nrewarding effects. The presence of\\nrewarding effects increases the\\nlikelihood that individuals will try to\\nobtain additional quantities of a drug.\\nAnimal self-administration of a drug is\\noften useful in suggesting whether\\nhumans will experience a particular\\nsubstance as having rewarding effects,\\nwhich is indicative of abuse potential.\\nFor example, the tendency of rhesus\\nmonkeys to self-administer a drug is\\ncorrelated with humans’ propensity to\\nabuse it. HHS Basis for Rec. at 12.\\nSince self-administration is a\\nmethodology in which the test drug is\\ntypically administered intravenously to\\nrats, it is not possible to evaluate\\nbotanical marijuana through selfadministration. However, given that D9-\\nTHC is the primary substance that\\nconfers abuse potential to marijuana, its\\nability to induce self-administration can\\nserve as an indicator of the abuse\\npotential of marijuana. HHS Basis for\\nRec. at 12.\\nHHS concluded, after weighing the\\nrelevant scientific evidence, that D9-\\nTHC produces rewarding effects that\\nlead an animal to repeatedly seek out\\nthe substance. HHS Basis for Rec. at 12.\\nSpecifically, some studies have\\ndemonstrated successful animal selfadministration of D9-THC following\\nintravenous administration,\\nadministration of inhaled vapor, oral\\nadministration, and\\nintracerebroventricular administration.\\nOther recent animal studies have not\\nbeen able to produce D9-THC selfadministration following intravenous\\nadministration and oral administration,\\nbut HHS concluded that these results\\nwere due to the specific methodology of\\nthose respective studies, rather than\\nvalid evidence of the rewarding effects\\nof D9-THC, and thus do not negate\\nHHS’s reliance on studies in which D9-\\nTHC was actively self-administered by\\nanimals. HHS Basis for Rec. at 12–13.\\nFurthermore, a comprehensive\\ndeconstruction of which animal\\nmethodology is optimal for producing\\npreclinical self-administration of D9-\\nTHC is not necessary for an evaluation\\nof the abuse potential of marijuana in\\nhumans because it is already clear that\\nhumans utilize marijuana for its\\nrewarding properties.

Animal self-administration is\\nused primarily to predict whether a\\nnovel substance is likely to be used by\\nhumans for its rewarding properties as\\nan indication of its abuse potential.\\nHowever, epidemiological data already\\namply demonstrates that humans selfadminister substances that contain D9-\\nTHC, including botanical marijuana, for\\ntheir ability to produce positive\\nsubjective responses, including\\neuphoria.

The studies in which D9-THC\\nsuccessfully produced CPP occurred\\nunder very specific experimental\\nconditions, similar to the D9-THC selfadministration studies in animals.\\nExperimental manipulations in CPP\\nstudies with D9-THC have included\\nvarying the animal species, sex, dose, or\\nroute of administration; introducing\\nflavors to obscure unpleasant taste; and\\nvarying the drug history of the animals\\ntested. However, as with animal selfadministration, the purpose of CPP\\nstudies is typically to determine if a\\nnew drug produces rewarding\\nsensations, which would suggest that a\\ndrug has abuse potential in humans.\\nSince it is clear that humans selfadminister substances that contain D9-\\nTHC, including botanical marijuana,\\nHHS determined that it was not\\nnecessary to determine which CPP\\nmethods are optimal for demonstrating\\nthat D9-THC has rewarding properties in\\nanimals.

Because animal drug\\ndiscrimination studies often use D9-THC\\nas the standard for establishing if new\\ndrugs have classic marijuana-like\\npharmacological activity, HHS did not\\nexamine whether this method should be\\napplied when evaluating the abuse\\npotential of D9-THC.

If the test drug\\nproduces rewarding effects that are\\nstatistically significantly greater than\\nthe placebo, and beyond the acceptable\\nplacebo range of response, it is an\\nindication that the drug may have abuse\\npotential. The relative abuse potential is\\nsuggested by the responses from the\\npositive control on these measures in\\ncomparison to the test drug. HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 15.\\nAfter analyzing a number of HAP\\nstudies of marijuana and D9-THC, which\\nvaried in the in dose of D9-THC, the\\nroute of administration, or whether the\\nD9-THC was provided in the form of\\nmarijuana or isolated compound, HHS\\nidentified a number of commonalities.\\nFirst, following administration of the\\nstudy drug (i.e., marijuana or D9-THC),\\nthere were increases in positive\\nsubjective responses. Second, the\\nstudies demonstrated increases on the\\nAddiction Research Center Inventory\\nscales for the morphine benzedrine\\ngroup (euphoria), marijuana, and\\namphetamine. HHS concluded that\\nthese data consistently demonstrated\\nthat D9-THC, in the form of marijuana\\nor as an isolated compound, produces\\nrewarding effects that are indicative of\\nabuse potential when it is administered\\nunder controlled experimental\\nconditions. Third, and in contrast to the\\nprior findings, the data also\\ndemonstrated that the administration of\\nmarijuana or D9-THC may result in\\nnegative subjective responses reflecting\\nnegative drug effects and sedation; these\\nare often delayed in onset from when\\nthe positive subjective effects begin.\\nHHS noted that the positive and\\nnegative subjective responses following\\nadministration of marijuana or D9-THC\\nwere often dose-dependent. It also noted\\nthat there were typically few differences\\nbetween responses to marijuana and D9-\\nTHC, or between responses based on\\nroute of administration of the study\\ndrug. HHS Basis for Rec. at 15.\\nCommon Responses to Marijuana in\\nHumans Published in Scientific and\\nMedical Literature\\nHHS concluded that the responses to\\ndronabinol reported during\\ndevelopment of Marinol and the\\nresponses to marijuana and D9-THC\\nreported in HAP studies paralleled the\\ncommon responses to marijuana that\\nhave been described by other medical\\nscientists. These responses include\\npositive subjective responses (such as\\neuphoria or happiness), sedative\\nresponses (such as drowsiness or\\nchanges in sleep), anxiety and negative\\nresponses (such as panic attacks,\\nagitation, and paranoia), perceptual\\nchanges (such as hallucinations and\\nchanges in perception), psychiatric,\\nsocial, and cognitive changes (such as\\ndrug abuse, delusions, memory and\\nconcentration impairment, and\\nimpaired judgment), and physiological\\nresponses (such as nausea, tachycardia,\\nfacial flushing, dry mouth, tremor,\\ndizziness, ataxia, and hyperemesis). The\\nliterature reviewed by HHS also\\nconcluded that the positive changes that\\noccur following use of marijuana are\\npleasurable to many humans and are\\nassociated with drug-seeking and drugtaking; and that these effects are\\ntypically dose-dependent, with higher\\ndoses and routes of administration that\\nproduce faster onset producing more\\nintense responses and the likelihood of\\nmore negative subjective effects. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 16–17.\\nNational Academies of Science,\\nEngineering, and Medicine (NASEM)\\nHHS also reviewed a book-length\\nevaluation of marijuana by NASEM\\nentitled The Health Effects of Cannabis\\nand Cannabinoids: The Current State of\\nEvidence and Recommendations for\\nResearch.17 According to HHS, in this\\nevaluation, NASEM provided a brief\\nsummary of the clinical features of\\nmarijuana intoxication and found that\\n(1) during acute cannabis intoxication,\\nthe user’s sociability and sensitivity to\\ncertain stimuli (e.g., colors, music) may\\nbe enhanced, the perception of time is\\naltered, and the appetite for sweet and\\nfatty foods is heightened; (2) some users\\nreport feeling relaxed or experiencing a\\npleasurable rush or buzz after smoking\\ncannabis; (3) these subjective effects\\nwere often associated with decreased\\nshort-term memory, dry mouth, and\\nimpaired perception and motor skills;\\nand (4) when very high blood levels of\\nD9-THC were attained, persons might\\nexperience panic attacks, paranoid\\nthoughts, and hallucinations. HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 17–18.\\nHHS Conclusion With Respect to\\nFactor 2\\nBased on its analysis of the studies\\ndiscussed above, HHS concluded that\\nD9-THC, the substance largely\\nresponsible for the abuse potential of\\nmarijuana, is a partial agonist at the\\ncannabinoid CB1 receptor. When D9-\\nTHC is administered to animals, it\\nproduces rewarding responses, as\\nevidenced by its ability to induce selfadministration and CPP. This is\\nconsistent with the data from human\\nstudies and from clinical observations,\\nwhere administration of D9-THC or use\\nof marijuana produces euphoria and\\nother pleasurable responses, as well as\\nsedation and anxiety responses.\\nPsychiatric, social, and cognitive\\nresponses, which are often experienced\\nas negative, are also reported, as are\\nphysiological responses such as dry\\nmouth, ataxia, and increased hunger. As\\ndescribed in HHS’s analysis of Factor 4,\\nsee HHS Basis for Rec. at 32–37, the\\nrewarding responses observed in\\nhumans are consistent with the\\nprevalence of nonmedical use of\\nmarijuana, which includes abuse of the\\nsubstance. Abuse of marijuana by\\nindividuals can lead to other negative\\nconsequences, including addiction and\\nthe need to seek medical attention\\nthrough calls to poison centers or visits\\nto an ED, as described in Factor 5, see\\nHHS Basis for Rec. at 38–39, 42.

A\\nlongstanding and significant historical\\ndebate by botanists and taxonomists\\ncontinues today regarding the number of\\nspecies in the Cannabis genus, but it is\\ngenerally treated as a single, highly\\npolymorphic species known as\\nCannabis sativa L., with the other two\\npreviously reported species listed as\\nCannabis indica Lam. and Cannabis\\nruderalis Janisch. Plants previously\\nbelieved to be part of the latter two\\nspecies are generally recognized as\\nvarieties (or subspecies) of Cannabis\\nsativa L., which are commonly referred\\nto as sativa var. indica and sativa var.\\nruderalis. Cannabis sativa and sativa\\nvar. indica plants are widely cultivated\\nfor their size, branching, and\\ncannabinoid content, while sativa var.\\nruderalis is rarely cultivated alone\\nbecause it is shorter, is often\\nunbranched, and has very low\\ncannabinoid content. Worldwide\\nCannabis varieties are separated into\\nhundreds of different cultivars and\\nstrains. Plants selected for cultivation\\nare known as cultivated varieties or\\ncultivars, whereas plants reproduced\\nasexually from a cultivar through clonal\\npropagation are known as strains. These\\npractices have resulted in significantly\\ndifferent chemical profiles for Cannabis\\ncultivars, and the classification term to\\naccount for these chemical profile\\ndifferences has evolved. The term\\n‘‘chemovar’’ accounts for the plant’s\\nchemical profile and is a more\\nmeaningful classification for clinical\\nresearchers studying the plant’s\\npotential drug effects. Marijuana\\nproducts developed from diverse\\nchemovars will have different safety,\\nbiological, pharmacological, and\\ntoxicological profiles. HHS Basis for\\nRec. at 18–19.\\nCannabis is a dioecious plant,\\nmeaning female and male flowers occur\\non separate plants, and rarely occurs as\\na monoecious plant (i.e., single plant\\ncontaining male and female flowers).\\nThe glandular trichomes found on the\\nfemale plant’s unfertilized flower heads\\nand bracts contain the highest\\nconcentrations of cannabinoids. For this\\nreason, unfertilized female chemovars\\nare favored to harvest large\\ninflorescences (i.e., complete flower\\nhead) for their rich cannabinoid and\\nterpene content. HHS Basis for Rec. at\\n19.\\nThe Cannabis sativa L. plant naturally\\ncontains many different compounds,\\nand more than 550 have been identified,\\nsuch as cannabinoids, terpenoids,\\nflavonoids, stilbenoids, steroids,\\npolysaccharides, benzoquinone,\\nphenanthrenes, spiroindans, lignans,\\nfatty acids, sugars, hydrocarbons, amino\\nacids, and proteins. Cannabinoids are\\nmainly found in living Cannabis sativa\\nL. plants in their non-psychoactive\\ncarboxylated forms (i.e., acid form),\\nwhich require drying, heating,\\ncombustion, or aging to decarboxylate to\\ntheir neutral forms, and are primarily\\ncomposed of C21 terpenophenolic\\ncompounds. The most abundant neutral\\nform cannabinoids are D9-THC and\\nCBD, but nearly 200 have been\\nidentified in the plant and are divided\\ninto subclasses: cannabigerols,\\ncannabichromenes, CBDs, D9-THCs, (-)-\\nD8-trans-tetrahydrocannabinols (‘‘D8-\\nTHCs’’), cannabicyclols, cannabielsoins,\\ncannabinols, cannabinodiols,\\ncannabitriols, and the miscellaneous\\ncannabinoids. HHS Basis for Rec. at 19.\\nLike any other botanical substance,\\nmarijuana plants are heterogeneous in\\nnature and contain a complex chemical\\nprofile. Moreover, variable organic plant\\nmaterial, as well as manufactured\\npreparations, result in a variety of\\nproduct forms that dictate different\\nroutes of administration, associated\\nrisks, and differences in quality of the\\nproduct used, which may also influence\\nrisk for users. Among other things, these\\ndifferences can result from differences\\nin harvest location, growing conditions,\\nthe season in which the marijuana is\\nharvested, and the manner in which the\\nmarijuana is processed, handled,\\ntransported, and tested. The potential\\nfor high variability of marijuana and\\nmarijuana-derived products, both in\\nproduct composition and impurity\\nprofile, is a major consideration for the\\npotential variability of drug effects and\\nsafety. HHS Basis for Rec. at 19–20.\\nProcessing of marijuana and its use in\\nfurther manufacturing can lead to a\\nrange of forms that individuals may use\\nor consume, including crude mixtures\\nand highly purified substances of\\nbotanical origin, many of which may be\\ncannabinoid compounds. Among\\nknown cannabinoids in the Cannabis\\nplant, both D9-THC and D8-THC\\nproduce marijuana’s psychoactive\\neffects. Because D9-THC is significantly\\nmore abundant than D8-THC,\\nmarijuana’s intoxicating effects are\\nlargely attributed to the former. Only\\nsmall quantities of D8-THC acid and D8-\\nTHC have been identified in plants.\\nHHS Basis for Rec. at 20.\\nAs noted above, the 2018\\namendments to the CSA removed hemp\\nfrom the definition of marijuana.\\nHowever, the term ‘‘cannabis’’ is still\\noften broadly used to refer to a wide\\nvariety of products manufactured from\\nthe Cannabis sativa L. plant, regardless\\nof their control status. As a result of the\\n2018 amendments to the CSA, a large\\nhemp marketplace exists, containing a\\nwide variety of products. In addition,\\nthe public has access to cannabis\\nproducts within the CSA definition of\\nmarijuana through State-authorized\\nadult-use (i.e., nonmedical use) and\\nmedical-use programs, as well as via the\\nillicit marketplace. See HHS Basis for\\nRec. at 28–37 (Factor 4). Because of\\nthese diverse sources of marijuana, there\\nis a lack of unified controls on\\ncultivation and manufacturing, which\\nraises concerns related to the safety,\\nquality, and consistency of botanical\\nsubstances (e.g., botanical raw materials,\\nextracts, and intermediates) and final\\nproduct formulations that are currently\\naccessed for medical and nonmedical\\nuse. Products sourced from Stateauthorized adult-use and medical-use\\nprograms are subject to a patchwork of\\ninconsistent product standards and\\nsafety requirements. Although some\\nState programs have a set of standards\\n(for example, on manufacturing, testing,\\nlabeling, and packaging), each program’s\\ncontrols are different, leading to a wide\\nvariation of products across Stateauthorized programs. And the illicit\\nmarketplace is not subject to any\\nstandards or oversight. As a result, the\\nrange of products within the CSA’s\\ndefinition of marijuana encompasses a\\nlarge degree of variation in forms for\\nconsumption, composition of\\nbiologically relevant constituents,\\npotency, and contaminants. HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 21.\\nIn short, marijuana has hundreds of\\nchemovars containing variable\\nconcentrations of D9-THC,\\ncannabinoids, and other compounds. As\\na result, in evaluating whether to\\nrecommend that marijuana be\\nrescheduled, HHS focused to the\\ngreatest extent possible on wide-ranging\\nsubstances derived from cannabis plants\\nthat are vehicles for the selfadministration of D9-THC as the key\\nbiologically active substance on which\\nthe CSA’s current definition of\\nmarijuana is based.

Once marijuana is\\ninhaled, D9-THC is absorbed through\\nthe lungs in the form of an aerosol\\nwithin seconds. Peak plasma levels of\\nD9-THC following inhalation occur very\\nquickly, within 6 to 10 minutes.\\nPsychoactive effects begin immediately\\nfollowing absorption, although peak\\nsubjective effects do not coincide with\\npeak plasma D9-THC levels and are\\noften delayed. Following administration\\nof marijuana through inhalation, the\\nbioavailability of D9-THC is 10 percent\\nto 35 percent. That bioavailability is\\nrelatively low and varies widely due to\\nseveral factors. An individual’s\\nexperience and technique with smoking\\nmarijuana also determines the dose\\nabsorbed. HHS Basis for Rec. at 22.\\nWhen marijuana or D9-THC is\\nadministered orally (such as by eating\\nmarijuana-infused foods), the effects\\nstart within 30 to 90 minutes, reach\\ntheir peak at 1.5 to 3 hours, and remain\\nmeasurable for 4 to 12 hours. Oral\\nbioavailability of D9-THC, following\\ningestion of an edible containing\\nmarijuana or isolated D9-THC, ranges\\nfrom 5 to 20 percent. The low and\\nvariable bioavailability of D9-THC from\\noral ingestion is a consequence of its\\nfirst-pass hepatic elimination from\\nblood and erratic absorption from\\nstomach and bowel. Ingestion of\\nbrownies containing marijuana also\\nresults in lower D9-THC plasma levels\\nrelative to inhalation of marijuana. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 22–23.\\nAlthough there are differences in\\nabsorption of D9-THC depending on\\nroute of administration, the distribution,\\nmetabolism, and excretion of D9-THC is\\nsimilar regardless of how the drug is\\nadministered. Plasma concentrations of\\nD9-THC decrease quickly after\\nabsorption through rapid distribution\\ninto tissues and through liver\\nmetabolism. Because D9-THC has high\\nlipophilicity, the apparent volume of\\ndistribution of D9-THC is high (10 L/kg)\\nas it is distributed initially into organs\\nsuch as lung, heart, brain, and liver that\\nare highly perfused. Over time with\\nregular exposure to marijuana, D9-THC\\nwill concentrate and be retained in fat.\\nHHS Basis for Rec. at 23.\\nMetabolism of D9-THC occurs\\nprimarily via cytochrome P450\\nisozymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and\\nCYP3A4) via microsomal hydroxylation\\nto both active and inactive metabolites.\\nThe primary active metabolite of D9-\\nTHC is 11-hydroxy-D9-THC. D9-THC\\nclears from the blood relatively rapidly,\\nlargely because it is redistributed to\\nother tissues in the body. Metabolism of\\nD9-THC in most tissues is relatively\\nslow or absent. The majority of the\\nabsorbed D9-THC dose is eliminated in\\nfeces, and about 33 percent in urine.\\nHHS Basis for Rec. at 23.\\nHHS Conclusion With Respect to\\nFactor 3\\nIn conclusion, HHS found that the\\npharmacokinetic profile of marijuana\\nvaries greatly depending on route of\\nadministration. Inhalation of marijuana\\nproduces a rapid increase in plasma\\nlevels of D9-THC and an immediate\\nonset of psychological effects. In\\ncomparison, oral administration of\\nmarijuana produces a much slower\\nincrease in plasma levels of D9-THC and\\nonset of psychological effects. Once D9-\\nTHC has been absorbed, however, the\\nmetabolism and excretion of D9-THC\\nfollows a standard path. HHS Basis for\\nRec. at 24.\\nDEA likewise notes that there is\\nconsiderable variability in the\\ncannabinoid concentrations and\\nchemical constituency among marijuana\\nsamples and that the interpretation of\\nclinical data related to marijuana is\\ncomplicated. A primary issue is the lack\\nof consistent concentrations of D9-THC\\nand other substances in marijuana,\\nwhich complicates the interpretation of\\nthe effects of different marijuana\\nconstituents. Additionally, the noncannabinoid components in marijuana\\nmay potentially modify the overall\\npharmacological and toxicological\\nproperties of various marijuana strains\\nand products. DEA anticipates that\\nadditional data on other marijuana\\nconstituents, routes of administration of\\nmarijuana, and the impact on D9-THC\\npotency may be appropriate for\\nconsideration.\\n4. Marijuana’s History and Current\\nPattern of Abuse\\nThe fourth factor that DOJ and HHS\\nmust consider under 21 U.S.C. 811(c) is\\nmarijuana’s history and current pattern\\nof abuse, which can include its abuse\\nrelative to relevant comparator\\nsubstances that are abused. See HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 28–37. HHS concluded\\nthat it is appropriate to consider the\\nFederal- and State-level history of\\nmarijuana control, marijuana sources for\\nnonmedical and medical use, marijuana\\nuse in the United States since passage\\nof the CSA, and current patterns of use\\nand abuse of marijuana. HHS Basis for\\nRec. at 28.\\nFederal History of Marijuana Control\\nAccording to HHS, marijuana was\\ndescribed in the United States\\nPharmacopoeia 18 as early as 1850.\\nAround the time that Congress passed\\nthe Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906,\\nPublic Law 59–384, 34 Stat. 768, drugs\\nsuch as marijuana, alcohol, heroin,\\nmorphine, and cocaine began to be\\ncharacterized by the Federal\\nGovernment as addictive and\\ndangerous. These drugs were frequently\\nincluded in patent medicines, often\\nwithout the consumer’s knowledge. The\\n1906 law required accurate drug\\nlabeling with respect to ingredients and\\ndosage. But it did not prohibit the sale\\nor possession of drugs characterized as\\naddictive and dangerous drugs,\\nincluding marijuana. As nonmedical use\\nof marijuana and opioids became more\\npopular in the United States, Congress\\nprovided funding in 1929 for two\\n‘‘narcotic farms’’ in Lexington,\\nKentucky, and Fort Worth, Texas, which\\nwere medical treatment centers run by\\nthe Public Health Service for federal\\nprisoners who were ‘‘habitual users of\\nnarcotics,’’ including marijuana-derived\\nproducts. HHS Basis for Rec. at 28–29.\\nIn the first half of the twentieth\\ncentury, marijuana use was curbed by\\nseveral Federal laws. In 1931, the\\nimportation of marijuana into the\\nUnited States began to be restricted\\nunder regulations under the Pure Food\\nand Drug Act, except for medicinal\\npurposes. The Marihuana Tax Act of\\n1937, Public Law 75–238, 50 Stat. 551,\\nimposed taxes that effectively\\nprohibited marijuana use for medical,\\nnonmedical, scientific, or industrial\\npurposes. Five years later, in 1942,\\nmarijuana was removed from the United\\nStates Pharmacopoeia. Through the\\nimposition of mandatory minimums, the\\nBoggs Act of 1951, Public Law 82–255,\\n65 Stat. 767, lengthened the average\\nsentence for first time marijuana\\noffenders to 2 to 5 years, similar to that\\nfor opioid offenses, regardless of\\nwhether the individual was a\\nnonmedical user or a trafficker. The\\nNarcotic Control Act of 1956, Public\\nLaw 84–728, 70 Stat. 567, increased the\\nminimum sentence for a first offender\\nfor marijuana to 2 to 10 years.

As HHS observed, the\\n2017 NASEM report stated that the\\nprevalence of marijuana use peaked in\\nthe late 1970s, declined through the\\n1980s, and then increased again in the\\nmid-1990s. From 2007 to 2017, there\\nwere steady year-over-year increases in\\nthe share of the general population that\\nused marijuana in the past month,\\nalthough there is no clear explanation\\nfor the post-2007 increase in use rates.\\nHHS Basis for Rec. at 31–32.\\nCurrent Patterns of Use and Abuse of\\nMarijuana\\nIn considering current patterns of use\\nand abuse of marijuana and marijuanaderived products, HHS analyzed\\nepidemiological databases from 2015 to\\nthe most recent years of available data\\n(which vary among data sources). A\\nwide variety of epidemiological\\ndatabases provide necessary data for\\nHHS’s analyses. These include the\\nNSDUH; Behavioral Risk Factor\\nSurveillance System (‘‘BRFSS’’);\\nResearch Abuse, Diversion and\\nAddiction-Related Surveillance\\n(‘‘RADARS’’); Nonmedical Use of\\nPrescription Drugs (‘‘NMURx’’);\\nMonitoring the Future (‘‘MTF’’); Youth\\nRisk Behavioral Surveillance System\\n(‘‘YRBSS’’); and International Cannabis\\nPolicy Study (‘‘ICPS’’). HHS Basis for\\nRec. at 32.\\nNational Survey on Drug Use and\\nHealth\\nBased on NSDUH data, HHS\\nconcluded that from 2015 to 2019 the\\npast-year use of marijuana for any\\nreason (nonmedical and medical) among\\npeople ages 12 years and older\\nincreased from 14 percent to 18 percent.\\nBy contrast, past-year (nonmedical and\\nmedical) use of comparator drugs that\\nhave FDA-approved therapeutic\\nindications declined or remained\\nrelatively stable over the same\\ntimeframe, including hydrocodone (22\\npercent to 16 percent), benzodiazepines\\n(12 percent to 11 percent, 2017 to 2019\\nonly), oxycodone (11 percent to 9\\npercent), tramadol (7 percent to 6\\npercent), zolpidem (4 percent to 3\\npercent), and ketamine (less than 1\\npercent). Although there were trend\\nbreaks for the years 2020 and 2021,20\\nmarijuana past-year use continued to\\nincrease during these two years. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 32–33.\\nBased on NSDUH data, HHS\\nconcluded that from 2015 to 2019, the\\nprevalence of past-year nonmedical use\\nof marijuana (i.e., use without a health\\ncare provider (‘‘HCP’’) recommendation)\\namong people ages 12 years and older\\nalso increased. HHS’s finding was based\\non an increase in the prevalence of\\noverall nonmedical use of marijuana\\nfrom 12 percent to 15 percent and on an\\nincrease in nonmedical use of marijuana\\nonly, without nonmedical use of other\\ndrugs that are abused, from 8 percent to\\n11 percent during this period. There\\nwas a slight decrease in both categories\\nin 2020, but the prevalence of both\\nkinds of uses increased again in 2021 (to\\n16 percent and 11 percent, respectively)\\nto levels that were higher than those\\nreported in 2019. In contrast, the\\nprevalence of past-year nonmedical use\\nof comparator drugs was less than 3\\npercent for heroin, cocaine, oxycodone,\\nhydrocodone, tramadol,\\nbenzodiazepines, and zolpidem, which\\nis much less than that for marijuana,\\neither alone or with other drugs. Over\\nthe 2015 to 2021 reporting period, the\\noverall use of these comparator drugs\\ndeclined slightly or remained fairly\\nstable. Notably, the majority of\\nindividuals who reported nonmedical\\nuse of marijuana did not report\\nnonmedical use of the comparator\\ndrugs. And over the same reporting\\nperiod of 2015 to 2021, the prevalence\\nof past-year use of alcohol ranged from\\n62 percent to 65 percent for individuals\\nages 12 years and older, far exceeding\\nthe prevalence for marijuana or other\\ncomparator drugs. These data\\ndemonstrate that alcohol has the highest\\nprevalence of past-year-only use,\\nfollowed by nonmedical use of\\nmarijuana.

HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 45.\\nHHS Conclusion With Respect to\\nFactor 5\\nIn HHS’s view, the most notable\\nconclusion from its evaluation of\\nepidemiological databases related to the\\nmedical outcomes from drug abuse is\\nthat, for all evaluated measures from\\n2015 to 2020, the rank order of\\ncomparators in terms of greatest adverse\\nconsequences typically placed alcohol\\n(unscheduled), heroin (schedule I), and\\ncocaine (schedule II) in the first or\\nimmediately subsequent position, with\\nmarijuana in a lower position. This\\npattern also held for PC data for serious\\nmedical outcomes, including death,\\nwhere marijuana was in the lowest\\nranking group. HHS determined that\\nthis demonstrated that there is\\nconsistency across databases, across\\nsubstances, and over time, and that\\nalthough abuse of marijuana produces\\nclear evidence of harmful consequences,\\nincluding SUD, the consequences are\\nrelatively less common and less harmful\\nthan some other comparator drugs.\\nAdditionally, HHS concluded, the\\nnumber of law enforcement encounters\\nwith marijuana decreased from 2020 to\\n2021, at a time when law enforcement\\nencounters were increasing for other\\nscheduled drugs of abuse. However, as\\nit noted with respect to Factor 1.A, HHS\\nemphasized that there are limitations in\\ncomparing descriptive data on adverse\\noutcomes across drugs, although\\ndescriptive analyses of epidemiologic\\ndata are an established practice in\\nprevious eight-factor analyses. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 45.\\nIn 2016, DEA found that abuse of\\nmarijuana is widespread and significant.\\n81 FR 53739. In addition, DEA found in\\n2016 that a significant proportion of all\\nadmissions for substance abuse\\ntreatment are for marijuana/hashish as\\nthe primary drug of abuse. Id. DEA\\nnotes that national data demonstrate\\nthat marijuana is one of the most widely\\nused federally illicit substances in the\\nUnited States, consistent with findings\\nfrom the HHS Basis for\\nRecommendation. According to the\\nNSDUH, in 2022, among people aged 12\\nor older in the United States, an\\nestimated 61.9 million people (22\\npercent) had used marijuana in the past\\nyear, and 42.3 million (15.0 percent)\\nhad used it in the past month. DEA\\nnotes that, according to one National\\nInstitutes of Health-supported study, the\\nprevalence of daily marijuana use\\nreached its highest level reported in\\n2021, at 11 percent of Americans aged\\n12 or older, a 3 percent increase from\\n2017 and a 5 percent increase from\\n2012.27 It also notes that the average\\npercentage of D9-THC in seized\\nmarijuana has increased over time.28\\nAlso, TEDS data showed that, in 2020,\\nmarijuana was the primary drug of\\nadmission in approximately 10 percent\\nof all admissions to substance abuse\\ntreatment among patients aged 12 and\\nolder. HHS Basis for Rec. at 41, 46. DEA\\nalso notes that TEDS data for 2021\\nreported that marijuana/hashish was the\\nprimary substance of abuse in 10.2\\npercent of all admissions to substance\\nabuse treatment among patients aged 12\\nand older.29 The 2021 TEDS data further\\nreported that New York, California,\\nGeorgia, North Carolina, New Jersey,\\nTexas, Minnesota, South Carolina,\\nFlorida, and Connecticut accounted for\\n55.9 percent of admissions to substance\\nuse treatments services where\\nmarijuana/hashish was listed as the\\nprimary substance.30 DEA also believes\\nthat additional information regarding\\nthe scope, duration, and significance of\\nmarijuana abuse may be appropriate for\\nconsideration in assessing this factor.\\n6. What, if Any, Risk There Is to the\\nPublic Health\\nThe sixth factor that DOJ and HHS\\nmust consider under 21 U.S.C. 811(c) is\\nthe risk posed to the public health by\\nmarijuana. In analyzing this factor, HHS\\nexamined NSDUH data related to the\\ndemographics of U.S. individuals\\nmeeting criteria for marijuana use\\ndisorder, TEDS data related to the\\ndemographics of admission to treatment\\ncenters for marijuana use disorder,\\nNEDS and NIS data on admissions to\\nEDs and hospitals related to marijuana\\npoisoning, ToxIC Core Registry data on\\nintentional and unintentional exposure,\\nand NPDS data describing the risks to\\nyouth of unintentional exposure to\\nmarijuana. HHS also assessed the risks\\nto the public health through NSDUH\\ndata on driving under the influence of\\nmarijuana in adults and high school\\nstudents. Finally, HHS reported data\\nregarding the risk of serious AEs and\\ndeath associated with nonmedical use/\\nuse of uncertain intent of marijuana as\\nreported to the FDA Adverse Event\\nReporting System, Center for Food\\nSafety and Applied Nutrition Adverse\\nEvent Reporting System, National Vital\\nStatistics System-Mortality (‘‘NVSS–\\nM’’), DAWN, FDA’s Sentinel Distributed\\nDatabase System, and Centers for\\nMedicare and Medicaid Services, and as\\nreflected in the Drug-Involved Mortality\\ndata linking NVSS–M to death\\ncertificates.

In summary,\\nHHS found that the risks to the public\\nhealth posed by marijuana are low\\ncompared to other drugs of abuse (e.g.,\\nheroin (schedule I), cocaine (schedule\\nII)), based on its evaluation of various\\nepidemiological databases for ED visits,\\nhospitalizations, unintentional\\nexposures, and, most importantly, for\\noverdose deaths. The rank order of\\ncomparator drugs in terms of greatest\\nadverse consequences typically places\\nheroin, benzodiazepines, or cocaine in\\nthe first or immediately subsequent\\npositions, with marijuana in a lower\\nplace in the ranking, especially when\\ncomparing among individuals who\\nreported using the respective drugs at\\nleast once in the prior year. For\\noverdose deaths, marijuana is always\\nranked the lowest among comparator\\ndrugs. HHS interpreted these\\nevaluations to demonstrate that there is\\nconsistent evidence across databases,\\nacross substances, and over time that,\\nalthough the abuse of marijuana poses a\\nrisk to public health, the risk is\\nrelatively lower than that posed by most\\nother comparator drugs. However, as\\nHHS noted in its discussion of Factor 1,\\nsee HHS Basis for Rec. at 7–8, there are\\nlimitations in comparing descriptive\\ndata on adverse outcomes across drugs.\\nHHS Basis for Rec. at 57.\\nIn 2016, DEA found that, ‘‘[t]ogether\\nwith the health risks outlined in terms\\nof pharmacological effects above, public\\nhealth risks from acute use of marijuana\\ninclude impaired psychomotor\\nperformance, impaired driving, and\\nimpaired performance on tests of\\nlearning and associative processes.\\nChronic use of marijuana poses a\\nnumber of other risks to the public\\nhealth including physical as well as\\npsychological dependence.’’ 81 FR\\n53739–40. In addition to the data\\nprovided in the HHS Basis for\\nRecommendation and the data\\nconsidered by HHS and DEA in their\\nprior eight-factor analyses, DEA\\nanticipates that additional data on\\npublic safety risks, risks from acute and\\nchronic marijuana use via oral and\\ninhaled administration routes, and the\\nimpact of D9-THC potency may be\\nappropriate for consideration.\\nAs discussed in the HHS Basis for\\nRecommendation, DEA notes that\\nstudies have examined the risk\\nassociated with marijuana use and\\ndriving. HHS Basis for Rec. at 50. The\\nRocky Mountain High Intensity Drug\\nTrafficking Area reported in a\\npublication that traffic deaths in\\nColorado in which drivers tested\\npositive for marijuana more than\\ndoubled from 55 in 2013 to 131 in 2020,\\nalthough other evidence in the same\\nreport suggests that driving under the\\ninfluence citations involving marijuana\\nhave grown at a rate similar to the rate\\nfor citations involving other drugs.31\\nDEA also identified some evidence\\nsuggesting that, among drivers who test\\npositive for at least one drug in a traffic\\nstop, a growing share test positive for\\ncannabis.32\\n7. Marijuana’s Psychic or Physiological\\nDependence Liability\\nThe seventh factor that DOJ and HHS\\nare required to consider under 21 U.S.C.\\n811(c) is the psychic or physiologic\\ndependence liability of marijuana.\\nA. Psychic Dependence\\nThe term ‘‘psychic or psychological\\ndependence’’ has been used to refer to\\na state similar to addiction. For\\ndiagnosis purposes, the DSM–V has\\ncombined the diagnoses ‘‘abuse’’ and\\n‘‘drug dependence’’ (i.e., addiction),\\nwhich the DSM’s Fourth Edition\\nspecified separately, into a single\\n‘‘substance use disorder,’’ which may\\noccur in a broad range of severity, from\\nmild to severe. HHS Basis for Rec. at 57.\\nThe abuse potential of a drug can be\\nassessed, in part, by evaluating the\\nrewarding effects produced by that drug\\nin humans and animals. As HHS\\ndescribed in its analysis of Factor 2, see\\nHHS Basis for Rec. at 12–13, rodent\\nbehavioral studies show that D9-THC\\nproduces both self-administration and\\nCPP. HHS determined that these results\\ndemonstrate that D9-THC has rewarding\\nproperties that are indicative of abuse\\npotential. Further, as HHS described in\\nits analysis of Factor 4, see HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 32–37, there is ample\\nepidemiological evidence that\\nmarijuana is self-administered by\\nhumans, which may result from its\\nability to produce rewarding\\npsychological effects, such as euphoria,\\nsee HHS Basis for Rec. at 15. HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 58.\\nIn some individuals, extensive use of\\nmarijuana can lead to SUD. HHS noted\\nthat, in general, SUDs listed in the\\nDSM–V are defined by an inability to\\ncease drug use despite harmful\\nconsequences; Cannabis Use Disorder\\n(‘‘CUD’’) shares this and other\\ndiagnostic criteria common to SUDs for\\nother drugs of abuse. Estimates of CUD\\nin individuals who regularly use\\nmarijuana vary and range from about 10\\nto 20 percent. These estimates are\\nsimilar to data from the United States\\nNational Comorbidity Study, which\\nshowed that 9 percent of lifetime\\ncannabis users met the criteria for\\ndependence outlined in the DSM’s\\nrevised Third Edition at some time in\\ntheir life, compared to 32 percent of\\ntobacco users, 23 percent of opiate\\nusers, and 15 percent of alcohol users.\\nThe National Epidemiologic Survey on\\nAlcohol and Related Conditions also\\nreported a nine percent lifetime\\ncumulative probability of transitioning\\nfrom marijuana use to dependence, with\\na higher risk of dependence in\\nindividuals with a history of psychiatric\\nor other substance dependence\\ncomorbidity. In the United States, data\\nfrom the 2020 NSDUH show that\\napproximately 14 million individuals\\naged 12 or older who use marijuana or\\nother cannabinoid preparations met\\ncriteria for CUD, representing 5.1\\npercent of all individuals aged 12 or\\nolder meeting the NSDUH survey\\ninclusion criteria. HHS Basis for Rec. at\\n58.\\nIndividuals who develop a SUD,\\nincluding CUD, may seek treatment.\\nFrom 2015 to 2020, TEDS documented\\napproximately 10.8 million treatment\\nepisode admissions reported by\\nindividuals treated at publicly funded\\nsubstance use treatment programs. Out\\nof 1.4 million treatment admissions\\ndocumented by TEDS in 2020,\\nmarijuana was reported as the primary\\nsubstance of abuse in approximately 10\\npercent of admissions, making it the\\nthird most frequently reported primary\\nsubstance of abuse, after alcohol (31.2\\npercent) and heroin (20.6 percent). A\\nsimilar pattern was seen from 2015 to\\n2019. HHS Basis for Rec. at 58.\\nHHS concluded that the animal\\nbehavioral data show that D9-THC\\nproduces rewarding properties that\\nunderlie the abuse potential of\\nmarijuana. Epidemiological data\\ndemonstrate that some individuals who\\nuse marijuana for its rewarding\\nproperties go on to develop CUD, which\\nshows that marijuana can produce\\npsychological dependence. Among\\nthose individuals who seek admission\\nfor treatment for SUD associated with a\\ndrug of abuse, marijuana was the third\\nmost frequently reported primary\\nsubstance of abuse. Thus, marijuana can\\nproduce psychic dependence in some\\nindividuals who use the drug. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 58–59.\\nB.

Abrupt discontinuation of\\nmarijuana after prolonged\\nadministration produces withdrawal\\nsymptoms in rats and in humans that\\nare typically opposite to those that\\noccur with activation of the CB1\\nreceptor. Precipitated withdrawal can\\nalso be induced with administration of\\nCB1 antagonists following chronic\\nadministration, while administration of\\nCB1 agonists can attenuate some\\nwithdrawal symptoms associated with\\nmarijuana discontinuation. These data\\nconfirm the importance of the CB1\\nreceptor in marijuana physical\\ndependence. HHS Basis for Rec. at 59.\\nHHS noted that research has not yet\\ndocumented the occurrence of\\nwithdrawal symptoms in individuals\\nwho use marijuana only occasionally.\\nHowever, in individuals who use\\nmarijuana heavily and chronically, drug\\ndiscontinuation can lead to a\\nwithdrawal syndrome. Most marijuana\\nwithdrawal symptoms begin within 24\\nto 48 hours of drug discontinuation,\\npeak within two to six days, and reduce\\nover one to two weeks as D9-THC levels\\ndecline. HHS Basis for Rec. at 59.\\nThe most commonly reported\\nwithdrawal symptoms from clinical\\ninvestigations are sleep difficulties,\\ndecreased appetite and weight loss,\\ncraving, irritability, anger, anxiety or\\nnervousness, and restlessness. Less\\ncommonly reported withdrawal\\nsymptoms include depressed mood,\\nsweating, shakiness, physical\\ndiscomfort, and chills. HHS described\\nthe symptoms of ‘‘cannabis withdrawal’’\\nlisted in the DSM–V as being similar to\\nthose reported in the experimental\\nstudies, including nervousness or\\nanxiety, irritability or aggression,\\ninsomnia or unpleasant dreams,\\ndepressed mood, decreased appetite or\\nweight loss, restlessness, abdominal\\npain, shakiness or tremors, sweating,\\nfever, chills, and headache. HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 59–60.\\nHHS reported that up to 40 to 50\\npercent of individuals who use\\nmarijuana on a regular basis may\\nexperience physical dependence. A\\nmeta-analysis of 23,518 individuals who\\nfrequently used marijuana showed that\\n47 percent of subjects reported\\nsymptoms of marijuana withdrawal. The\\nprevalence of physical dependence was\\n54 percent in outpatient samples, 17\\npercent in community samples, and 87\\npercent among inpatients in drug abuse\\ntreatment centers. This is consistent\\nwith data showing that 90 percent of\\nindividuals who were diagnosed with\\nCUD also reported physical\\ndependence. Further, individuals\\ndiagnosed with CUD experience more\\nsevere and longer lasting withdrawal\\nsymptoms when discontinuing\\nmarijuana than individuals who do not\\nhave a diagnosis of CUD. This may be\\nbecause individuals with CUD have\\ngreater exposure to marijuana. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 60.\\nSymptoms associated with marijuana\\nwithdrawal appear to be relatively mild\\ncompared to those associated with\\nalcohol withdrawal, which can include\\nagitation, paranoia, seizures, and even\\ndeath. Multiple studies comparing the\\nwithdrawal symptoms associated with\\ntobacco (not scheduled in the CSA) and\\nmarijuana demonstrate that the\\nmagnitude and time course of the two\\nwithdrawal syndromes are similar.\\nAnimal studies have shown that after\\nshort-term administration of\\nequianalgesic doses of heroin and D9-\\nTHC to monkeys, withdrawal signs were\\nobserved after heroin administration but\\nnot after D9-THC administration, further\\ndemonstrating that withdrawal from\\nmarijuana is associated with less severe\\nsymptoms than withdrawal from other\\ndrug classes. HHS Basis for Rec. at 60.\\nHHS Conclusion With Respect to\\nFactor 7\\nIn conclusion, HHS found\\nexperimental and clinical evidence that\\nchronic, but not acute, use of marijuana\\ncan produce both psychic and physical\\ndependence in humans.\\nEpidemiological data, discussed in\\ngreater detail in the sections describing\\nFactors 4 and 5 in sections VI.4 and VI.5\\nof this preamble, provide additional\\nevidence of psychic dependence. The\\nsymptoms associated with both kinds of\\ndependence are relatively mild for most\\nindividuals, although their severity may\\nbe greater with increased exposure to\\nmarijuana. HHS Basis for Rec. at 61.\\nIn 2016, DEA found that ‘‘[l]ong-term,\\nheavy use of marijuana can lead to\\nphysical dependence and withdrawal\\nfollowing discontinuation, as well as\\npsychic or psychological dependence.’’\\n81 FR 53740. DEA notes that some\\nphysicians have argued that CUD is\\nunderdiagnosed and undertreated in the\\nmedical setting,33 and that other\\nmedical professionals have noted that\\nCUD needs to be better understood and\\ncharacterized to better inform users and\\ntreatment professionals.34 DEA\\nanticipates that additional psychic or\\nphysiological dependence liability may\\nbe appropriate for consideration.\\n8. Whether Marijuana Is an Immediate\\nPrecursor of a Substance Already\\nControlled Under the CSA\\nThe eighth factor that DOJ and HHS\\nare required to consider under 21 U.S.C.\\n811(c) is whether marijuana is an\\nimmediate precursor of a substance\\nalready controlled under the CSA.

D9-\\nTHC has agonist properties at CB1\\ncannabinoid receptors and produces\\nrewarding responses in animals, as\\nevidenced by its ability to produce selfadministration and CPP. When\\nmarijuana is administered to humans\\nunder experimental conditions, it\\nproduces a wide range of positive\\nsubjective responses in addition to\\ncertain negative subjective responses.\\nCommon responses to marijuana when\\nit is used by individuals for nonmedical\\npurposes include euphoria and other\\npositive subjective responses, as well as\\nperceptual changes, sedative responses,\\nanxiety responses, psychiatric, social,\\nand cognitive changes, and\\nphysiological changes. HHS Basis for\\nRec. at 62.\\nHHS noted that epidemiological data\\nfrom NSDUH show that marijuana is the\\nmost frequently used federally illicit\\ndrug in the United States on a past-year\\nand past-month basis among the illicit\\ncomparator drugs considered. Although\\n50 percent of respondents in NSDUH\\nreported using marijuana nonmedically\\nfewer than 5 days per month, another 30\\npercent reported using it nonmedically\\nfor 20 days or more per month. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 62.\\nDespite the high prevalence of\\nnonmedical use of marijuana, HHS\\nobserved that an overall evaluation of\\nepidemiological indicators suggests that\\nit does not produce serious outcomes\\ncompared to drugs in schedules I or II.\\nHHS found this especially notable given\\nthe availability of marijuana and\\nmarijuana-derived products that contain\\nextremely high levels of D9-THC. Due to\\nsuch availability, the epidemiological\\ndata described in HHS’s evaluation\\ninherently include the outcomes from\\nindividuals who use marijuana and\\nmarijuana-derived products that have\\ndoses of D9-THC that range from low to\\nvery high, and yet the data demonstrate\\nthat these products overall are\\nproducing fewer negative outcomes than\\ndrugs in schedules I or II. HHS Basis for\\nRec. at 62.\\nHHS compared the rank ordering of\\nselected drugs that are abused for\\nvarious epidemiological measures and\\nobserved that marijuana was among the\\ndrugs at the very lowest ranking for a\\nnumber of measures, including PC\\nabuse cases, likelihood that any use\\nwould lead to a PC call, accidental or\\nunintentional poisoning, utilizationadjusted rates of unintentional\\nexposure, utilization-adjusted and\\npopulation-adjusted rates for ED visits\\nand hospitalizations, likelihood of being\\ndiagnosed with a serious SUD, deaths\\nreported to PCs, and overdose deaths\\nwhen used with other drugs or as a\\nsingle substance (as total numbers and\\nwhen utilization-adjusted). In contrast,\\ncomparators such as heroin (schedule I),\\noxycodone (schedule II), and cocaine\\n(schedule II) typically were in the\\nhighest rank ordering on these\\nmeasures. HHS Basis for Rec. at 62.\\nFor the various epidemiological\\nmeasures evaluated above, HHS noted\\nthat marijuana was also compared to\\ncontrolled substances in schedule III\\n(ketamine) and schedule IV\\n(benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and\\ntramadol), as well as to other schedule\\nII substances (fentanyl and\\nhydrocodone). The analyses were\\nconducted in this manner to provide a\\ncomprehensive assessment of the\\nrelative abuse potential of marijuana.\\nHowever, the rank order of these\\nsubstances regarding harms does not\\nconsistently align with the relative\\nscheduling placement of these drugs in\\nthe CSA due to the pharmacological\\ndifferences between various classes of\\ndrugs. HHS Basis for Rec. at 63.\\nThere are a number of confounding\\nfactors that likely influence the adverse\\noutcomes measured in various\\nepidemiological databases and account\\nfor the rank ordering of the drugs\\nevaluated on these measures. For\\nexample, a different population abuses\\neach substance, and each substance has\\na different prevalence of abuse and a\\ndifferent profile of severe adverse\\noutcomes in a setting of nonmedical use\\nand abuse. Thus, it is challenging to\\nreconcile the ranking of relative harms\\nassociated with the comparators used in\\nthis evaluation when the rankings differ\\nacross various epidemiological\\ndatabases and when these rankings\\noften do not align with the scheduling\\nplacement of these comparators under\\nthe CSA. HHS Basis for Rec. at 63.\\nTo address these challenges, HHS\\nevaluated the totality of the available\\ndata and has concluded that it supports\\nthe placement of marijuana in schedule\\nIII. Overall, these data demonstrate that,\\nalthough marijuana is associated with a\\nhigh prevalence of abuse, the profile of\\nand propensity for serious outcomes\\nrelated to that abuse lead to a\\nconclusion that marijuana is most\\nappropriately controlled in schedule III\\nunder the CSA. HHS Basis for Rec. at\\n63.\\nThe Attorney General has considered\\nHHS’s recommendations and\\nconclusions and accords HHS’s\\nscientific and medical determinations\\nbinding weight at this stage of the\\nscheduling process. See OLC Op. at *22\\nn.6 (‘‘HHS’s recommendations with\\nrespect to ‘scientific and medical\\nmatters’ are binding for all eight factors\\nlisted in section 811(c).’’). The Attorney\\nGeneral concurs with HHS’s\\nrecommendation, for purposes of\\ninitiation of these rulemaking\\nproceedings, that marijuana has a\\npotential for abuse less than the drugs\\nor other substances in schedules I and\\nII.\\n2. Currently Accepted Medical Use in\\nTreatment in the United States\\nIn 2016, HHS recommended a finding\\nthat marijuana had no CAMU due in\\npart to a lack of adequate safety studies\\nor evidence that qualified experts\\naccepted marijuana for use in treating a\\nspecific, recognized disorder. 81 FR\\n53688 at 53707. As a result of its most\\nrecent evaluation, which incorporates\\npost-2016 data into its analysis, HHS\\nrecommends a finding that marijuana\\nhas a CAMU.\\nIn making that recommendation, HHS\\nanalyzed whether there is (1)\\nwidespread current experience with\\nmedical use of the substance in the\\nUnited States by licensed health care\\npractitioners operating in accordance\\nwith implemented State-authorized\\nprograms, where the medical use is\\nrecognized by entities that regulate the\\npractice of medicine; and (2) some\\ncredible scientific support for a least\\none of those medical uses. Applying this\\ntest, HHS recommended a finding that\\nmarijuana has a currently accepted\\nmedical use in the United States,\\nspecifically for the treatment of anorexia\\nrelated to a medical condition, nausea\\nand vomiting (e.g., chemotherapyinduced), and pain. According to HHS,\\nits evaluation also supported a finding\\nthat there is accepted safety for the use\\nof marijuana under medical supervision\\nfor the treatment of anorexia related to\\na medical condition, nausea and\\nvomiting (e.g., chemotherapy-induced),\\nand pain.

FDA conducted Part 2 of the analysis for\\nthe medical conditions identified by OASH that\\nwere likely to have the most robust evidence\\navailable for review; because the analysis\\nconcluded that the Part 2 test has been met for at\\nleast one of the conditions identified in Part 1, there\\nwas no need to analyze all of them.

Specifically,\\nHHS observed that DEA’s tests left no\\nroom for an evaluation of (1) whether\\nthere is widespread medical use of a\\ndrug under the supervision of licensed\\nhealth care practitioners under Stateauthorized programs and, (2) if so,\\nwhether there is credible scientific\\nevidence supporting such medical use.\\nHHS therefore developed an alternative\\ntest composed of those two inquiries as\\na third, independently sufficient\\napproach for determining whether a\\nsubstance has a CAMU under the CSA.\\nHHS applied this two-part test to\\nmarijuana and recommended a finding\\nthat marijuana has a CAMU under the\\nCSA. HHS Basis for Rec. at 24–28.\\nUpon receiving HHS’s\\nrecommendation, the Attorney General\\nrequested that OLC advise on whether\\nHHS’s test, if satisfied, established a\\nCAMU ‘‘even if the drug has not been\\napproved by FDA and even if the drug\\ndoes not satisfy DEA’s five-part test.’’\\nOLC Op. at *3. OLC determined that\\nDEA’s current approach to determining\\nwhether a drug has a CAMU is\\nimpermissibly narrow, because it\\n‘‘ignor[es] widespread clinical\\nexperience with a drug that is\\nsanctioned by state medical licensing\\nregulators.’’ Id. at *13–14; see also id. at\\n*12. OLC further opined that satisfying\\nHHS’s two-part inquiry is sufficient to\\nestablish that a drug has a CAMU. Id. at\\n*4, *16–20. And OLC concluded that,\\nwhile HHS’s CAMU recommendation is\\nnot binding on DEA, the medical and\\nscientific determinations that underlie\\nits recommendation are binding until\\nthe initiation of formal rulemaking\\nproceedings, and that DEA must accord\\nthose determinations ‘‘significant\\ndeference’’ throughout the rulemaking\\nprocess. Id. at *4, *20–26.\\nUnder Part 1 of the HHS CAMU test,\\nthe Office of the Assistant Secretary for\\nHealth (‘‘OASH’’) considered whether\\nthere is widespread current experience\\nwith medical use of marijuana in the\\nUnited States by licensed HCPs\\noperating in accordance with\\nimplemented State-authorized\\nprograms, where such medical use is\\nrecognized by entities that regulate the\\npractice of medicine under these State\\njurisdictions. Part 2 of the CAMU test\\nevaluated whether there exists some\\ncredible scientific support for at least\\none of the medical conditions for which\\nthe Part 1 test is satisfied. The\\nevaluation in Part 2, undertaken by\\nFDA, was not meant to be, nor is it, a\\ndetermination of safety and efficacy\\nunder the Federal Food, Drug, and\\nCosmetic Act’s drug approval standard\\nfor new human or animal drugs. Rather,\\nHHS’s two-part test is designed to\\nevaluate whether a substance, in this\\ncase marijuana, has a CAMU for\\npurposes of drug scheduling\\nrecommendations and placement in a\\ndrug schedule consistent with criteria\\nset forth in 21 U.S.C. 812(b). HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 24.\\nIn the evaluation and assessment\\nunder Part 1 of the CAMU test, OASH\\nfound that more than 30,000 HCPs are\\nauthorized to recommend the use of\\nmarijuana for more than six million\\nregistered patients, constituting\\nwidespread clinical experience\\nassociated with various medical\\nconditions recognized by a substantial\\nnumber of jurisdictions across the\\nUnited States.

A\\nsystematic review of scientific and\\nmedical literature was conducted in\\n2023 by the University of Florida (‘‘UF’’)\\nunder contract with FDA. UF\\nepidemiologists identified some data\\nsupporting effectiveness of marijuana,\\nincluding some within their own metaanalysis; however, they ultimately\\nconcluded the results are inconclusive\\nor mixed. FDA also conducted a\\nseparate analysis of published scientific\\nreviews, several of which drew\\nconclusions similar to those of UF.

FDA’s review of systematic\\nreviews showed mixed results for these\\nindications. In particular, FDA found\\nthat the potential for psychiatric adverse\\nevents associated with treating PTSD\\nwith marijuana may be more substantial\\nthan any limited benefit in\\nobservational studies. Although UF did\\nnot conclude that there was evidence in\\nsupport of the effectiveness of marijuana\\nin IBD, both their review and other\\nsystematic reviews found some benefit\\nwith respect to subjective symptoms in\\nthis condition.

FDA\\nassessed the clinical safety data\\nidentified in the literature from\\ncontrolled trials as generally consistent\\nbetween sources but limited in the rigor\\nof safety reporting. FDA also explained\\nthat the vast majority of the\\nobservational studies evaluated in the\\ncontext of medical use were excluded\\nfrom the final synthesis of evidence due\\nto concerns regarding their quality (e.g.,\\nonly one observational study for the\\nanxiety indication and one for the PTSD\\nindication were included). According to\\nFDA, data on safety from both clinical\\ntrials and observational studies were\\ngenerally scarce, but the literature\\nshows that marijuana has more AEs\\nwhen compared to a placebo or active\\ncontrol group, however, typically in the\\nmild to moderate severity range.

HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 27.\\nFDA also considered position\\nstatements from professional\\norganizations relevant to the indications\\ndiscussed. The vast majority of\\nprofessional organizations did not\\nrecommend the use of marijuana in\\ntheir respective specialties; however,\\nnone specifically recommended against\\nit, with the exception of the American\\nPsychiatric Association, which stated\\nthat marijuana is known to worsen\\ncertain psychiatric conditions. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 27–28.\\nOn balance, FDA found the available\\ndata indicated that there is some\\ncredible scientific support for the use of\\nmarijuana in the treatment of chronic\\npain, anorexia related to a medical\\ncondition, and nausea and vomiting,\\nwith varying degrees of support and\\nconsistency of findings. Additionally,\\nno safety concerns were identified in\\nFDA’s review that would indicate that\\nmedical use of marijuana poses\\nunacceptably high safety risks for the\\nindications where there is some credible\\nscientific evidence supporting its\\ntherapeutic use. HHS Basis for Rec. at\\n28.\\nBased on the totality of the available\\ndata, FDA concluded that there exists\\nsome credible scientific support for the\\nmedical use of marijuana in at least one\\nof the indications for which there is\\nwidespread current experience in the\\nUnited States, as identified by OASH\\nunder Part 1 of the CAMU test. The\\nindications evaluated were anorexia\\nrelated to a medical condition, anxiety,\\nepilepsy, IBD, nausea and vomiting\\n(e.g., chemotherapy-induced), pain, and\\nPTSD. FDA clarified that the analysis\\nand conclusions on the available data\\nare not meant to imply that safety and\\neffectiveness have been established for\\nmarijuana that would support FDA\\napproval of a marijuana drug product\\nfor a particular indication.

See OLC Op.\\nat *24. Applying HHS’s two-part test,\\nand in light of OLC’s legal opinion that\\nthe HHS’s test is sufficient under the\\nCSA, the Attorney General concurs with\\nHHS’s conclusion, for purposes of the\\ninitiation of these rulemaking\\nproceedings, that there is a CAMU for\\nmarijuana.\\n3. Level of Physical or Psychological\\nDependence\\nAs a result of its most recent\\nevaluation, which incorporates post2016 data into its analysis, HHS has\\nrecommended a finding that abuse of\\nmarijuana may lead to moderate or low\\nphysical dependence or high\\npsychological dependence. HHS Basis\\nfor Rec. at 65.\\nAccording to HHS, clinical studies\\nhave demonstrated that marijuana\\nproduces physical and psychological\\ndependence. Regarding physical\\ndependence, as evidenced by its\\nassociated withdrawal symptomology\\nupon abrupt discontinuation of use, the\\nmost commonly reported marijuana\\nwithdrawal symptoms in clinical\\ninvestigations are sleep difficulties,\\ndecreased appetite and weight loss,\\ncraving, irritability, anger, anxiety or\\nnervousness, and restlessness.\\nMarijuana withdrawal symptoms\\ntypically peak within two to six days\\nand decline over one to two weeks as\\nD9-THC is eliminated. Similarly, the\\ndrug labels for the FDA-approved drug\\nproducts Marinol and Syndros state\\nthat, following chronic administration\\nof dronabinol, drug discontinuation\\nleads to irritability, insomnia, and\\nrestlessness at 12 hours, and by 24\\nhours the withdrawal symptoms can\\ninclude hot flashes, sweating,\\nrhinorrhea, diarrhea, and anorexia. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 64.\\nHHS observes that marijuana\\nwithdrawal syndrome has been reported\\nin individuals with heavy, chronic\\nmarijuana use, but its occurrence in\\noccasional users of marijuana has not\\nbeen established. The marijuana\\nwithdrawal syndrome appears to be\\nrelatively mild compared to the\\nwithdrawal syndrome associated with\\nalcohol, which can include more serious\\nsymptoms such as agitation, paranoia,\\nseizures and even death. Multiple\\nstudies comparing the withdrawal\\nsymptoms associated with marijuana\\nand tobacco demonstrate that the\\nmagnitude and time course of the two\\nwithdrawal syndromes are similar. HHS\\nBasis for Rec. at 64.\\nHHS also notes that the ability of\\nmarijuana to produce psychic\\ndependence is shown through its ability\\nto produce rewarding effects that\\nunderlie its nonmedical use and\\nepidemiological outcomes related to\\nabuse, as detailed in the first finding on\\nabuse potential. HHS Basis for Rec. at\\n64–65.\\nBased on the evidence, HHS\\ndetermined that the abuse of marijuana\\nmay lead to moderate or low physical\\ndependence, depending on frequency\\nand degree of marijuana exposure. HHS\\nfurther concluded that marijuana can\\nproduce psychic dependence in some\\nindividuals, but that the likelihood of\\nserious outcomes is low, suggesting that\\nhigh psychological dependence does not\\noccur in most individuals who use\\nmarijuana. HHS Basis for Rec. at 65.\\nThe Attorney General has considered\\nHHS’s recommendations and\\nconclusions and accords HHS’s\\nscientific and medical determinations\\nbinding weight at this stage of the\\nscheduling process. See OLC Op. at *22\\nn.6.

Circuit do\\nnot understand the ‘‘without regard’’ clause in\\nsection 811(d)(1) as prohibiting the Attorney\\nGeneral from following the normal scheduling\\npractices when international obligations are\\ninvolved. Instead, they have interpreted it as\\nrequiring the Attorney General to identify which\\nschedules would satisfy the international\\nobligations of the United States with respect to a\\nparticular drug and, if more than one schedule\\nwould do so, to select among schedules using the\\nprocedures set forth in sections 811(a), 811(b), and\\n812(b). See OLC Op. at *29 n.8; NORML II, 559 F.2d\\nat 747.\\n40Under the Single Convention, ‘‘‘[c]annabis\\nplant’ means any plant of the genus Cannabis.’’\\nSingle Convention art. 1(1)(c). The Single\\nConvention defines ‘‘cannabis’’ to mean ‘‘the\\nflowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant\\n(excluding the seeds and leaves when not\\naccompanied by the tops) from which the resin has\\nnot been extracted, by whatever name they may be\\ndesignated.’’ Id. art. 1(1)(b). This definition of\\n‘‘cannabis’’ under the Single Convention is slightly\\nless inclusive in certain respects than the CSA\\ndefinition of ‘‘marijuana,’’ which includes all parts\\nof the cannabis plant except for the mature stalks,\\nsterilized seeds, oil from the seeds, and certain\\nderivatives thereof. See 21 U.S.C. 802(16). Cannabis\\nand cannabis resin are included in the list of drugs\\nin Schedule I of the Single Convention, and\\ncannabis is subject to the same controls as Schedule\\nI drugs as well as additional controls. See Single\\nConvention art. 2(6); id. art. 28.\\nevaluation that the drug has a relatively\\nlower level of abuse compared to drugs\\ncurrently scheduled in schedules I and\\nII and its evaluation that marijuana may\\nlead to moderate or low physical\\ndependence and has a low likelihood of\\npsychic dependence. Consistent with\\nHHS’s analysis, the Attorney General\\nhas determined at this initial stage that\\nmarijuana does not appear to meet the\\nelements of a schedule II drug, which\\ninclude a high potential for abuse and\\na likelihood of severe physiological or\\nphysical dependence from such abuse.\\n21 U.S.C. 812(b)(3). Rather, marijuana’s\\nprofile as a drug with a lower degree of\\nabuse potential than schedule I (e.g.,\\nheroin) and schedule II (e.g., fentanyl,\\ncocaine) drugs and a moderate to low\\nlevel of physical dependence militates\\nin favor of rescheduling it in schedule\\nIII. Accordingly, in this notice of\\nproposed rulemaking, the Attorney\\nGeneral is proposing to reschedule\\nmarijuana in schedule III and solicits\\ncomments on these preliminary\\nfindings.\\nTypes of Marijuana To Be Rescheduled\\nThis rescheduling of marijuana would\\napply to marijuana as listed in 21 CFR\\n1308.11(d)(23). The rescheduling also\\nwould apply to marijuana extracts as\\ndefined in 21 CFR 1308.11(d)(58)\\nbecause they meet the statutory\\ndefinition of marijuana and, prior to\\n2017, were included in 21 CFR\\n1308.11(d)(23). See Establishment of a\\nNew Drug Code for Marihuana Extract,\\n81 FR 90194 (Dec. 14, 2016). In\\naddition, this proposal would apply to\\nD9-THC derived from the marijuana\\nplant (other than the mature stalks and\\nseeds) that falls outside the definition of\\nhemp, because it meets the statutory\\ndefinition of marijuana.\\nThis proposal would not apply to\\nsynthetically derived THC, which is\\noutside the CSA’s definition of\\nmarijuana. Those tetrahydrocannabinols\\nthat can be derived only through a\\nprocess of artificial synthesis (e.g., delta10-tetrahydrocannabinol) are excluded.\\nHHS provided a recommendation only\\nrelating to ‘‘marijuana’’ as defined in the\\nCSA. That definition is limited to the\\nplant (other than the mature stalks and\\nseeds) and derivatives of the plant.\\nTherefore, synthetic THC will remain in\\nschedule I. This rulemaking would not\\naffect the status of hemp (as defined in\\n7 U.S.C. 1639o), because hemp is\\nexcluded from the definition of\\nmarijuana. This rulemaking is not\\nproposing to reschedule any drug\\nproduct containing marijuana or THC\\nthat previously has been rescheduled\\nout of schedule I (e.g., Marinol and\\nSyndros). Nor does it impact the status\\nof any previously scheduled synthetic\\ncannabinoids.\\nVIII. International Treaty Obligations\\nIn proposing an appropriate schedule\\nfor marijuana, the Attorney General\\nmust also consider compliance with the\\ntreaty obligations of the United States.\\nAs the CSA recognizes, the United\\nStates is a party to the Single\\nConvention. 21 U.S.C. 801(7). Parties to\\nthe Single Convention are obligated to\\nmaintain various control provisions\\nrelated to the drugs that are covered by\\nthe treaty. See, e.g., Single Convention\\narts. 2, 4. Congress enacted many of the\\nCSA’s provisions for the specific\\npurpose of ensuring U.S. compliance\\nwith the treaty. See OLC Op. at *27.\\nAmong these is a scheduling provision,\\n21 U.S.C. 811(d)(1). Section 811(d)(1)\\nprovides that, where a drug is subject to\\ncontrol under the Single Convention,\\nthe Attorney General must ‘‘issue an\\norder controlling such drug under the\\nschedule he deems most appropriate to\\ncarry out such [treaty] obligations,\\nwithout regard to the findings required\\nby [21 U.S.C. 811(a) or 812(b)] and\\nwithout regard to the procedures\\nprescribed by [21 U.S.C. 811(a) and\\n(b)].’’ 39\\nMarijuana is a drug covered in the\\nSingle Convention under the term\\n‘‘cannabis.’’ 40 OLC initially advised in\\n1972 that controls under Article 21 of\\nthe Single Convention would not be\\nsatisfied if marijuana were listed in\\nschedule III, IV, or V of the CSA.\\nMemorandum for John E. Ingersoll,\\nDirector, Bureau of Narcotics and\\nDangerous Drugs, from Mary C. Lawton,\\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General,\\nOffice of Legal Counsel, Re: Petition to\\nDecontrol Marihuana; Interpretation of\\nSection 201 of the Controlled\\nSubstances Act of 1970 at 12–13 (Aug.\\n21, 1972). However, OLC has\\nreexamined the conclusion of its 1972\\nmemorandum, taking into account\\nstatutory amendments since 1972 and a\\npossibility it did not consider in 1972:\\nplacing marijuana into schedule III\\nwhile issuing regulations that would\\nenable the United States to comply with\\nits international obligations. OLC Op. at\\n*4, 26–35. OLC has concluded that both\\nthe Single Convention and the CSA\\nallow the Attorney General to satisfy the\\ntreaty obligations of the United States\\nwith respect to marijuana by\\nsupplementing scheduling decisions\\nwith additional controls under the CSA.\\nId.\\nIf marijuana were listed in schedule\\nIII, most of the Single Convention’s\\nobligations would continue to be met by\\nCSA statutory authorities and associated\\nregulations. See OLC Op. at *33–34.\\nOne potential gap concerns the quota on\\nmanufacturing cannabis required by\\nArticle 21 of the Convention, but that\\ngap can be filled using the CSA’s\\nregulatory authorities. See id. at *34; see\\nalso, e.g., 21 U.S.C. 821 (authorizing the\\nAttorney General to impose restrictions\\n‘‘relate[ed] to the . . . control of the\\nmanufacture’’ of a drug); id. 871(b)\\n(authorizing the Attorney General to\\nissue regulations ‘‘necessary and\\nappropriate for the efficient execution of\\nhis functions under this subchapter’’);\\nid. 822(b) (allowing the Attorney\\nGeneral to regulate ‘‘the extent’’ of\\nmanufacture of a drug through\\nregistration); id. 823(e) (requiring the\\nAttorney General to register an\\napplicant to manufacture a schedule III\\ndrug ‘‘unless he determines that the\\nissuance of such registration is\\ninconsistent with the public interest’’).\\nIn addition, if marijuana is transferred\\ninto schedule III, DEA will continue to\\nhave authority to maintain its existing\\nregulatory scheme, located at 21 CFR\\npart 1318, governing the registration of\\nmanufacturers seeking to plant, grow,\\ncultivate, or harvest marijuana, as\\nrequired to comply with Articles 23 and\\n28 of the Single Convention. Authority\\nfor those regulations currently flows\\nfrom 21 U.S.C. 823(a), which is\\napplicable to drugs in schedules I and\\nII. OLC has concluded, however, that 21\\nU.S.C. 823(e), which is applicable to\\ndrugs in schedules III, IV, and V,\\nprovides an alternative source of\\nauthority for complying with Articles 23\\nand 28 of the Single Convention.

The CSA also\\nrecognizes that the United States is also\\na party to the Convention on\\nPsychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971,\\n32 U.S.T. 543, 1019 U.N.T.S. 175\\n(‘‘Convention on Psychotropic\\nSubstances’’). See also 21 U.S.C.\\n801a(2). As with the Single Convention,\\nparties to the Convention on\\nPsychotropic Substances are obligated\\nto take various control measures related\\nto the drugs that are covered by the\\ntreaty. Id. Congress implemented the\\nadditional authority necessary to\\ncomply with the Convention on\\nPsychotropic Substances through\\nvarious amendments to the CSA. Id.\\n801a(2)–(3).\\nD9-THC is a substance covered by\\nschedule II of the Convention on\\nPsychotropic Substances. In this rule,\\nDOJ proposes to reschedule D9-THC that\\nfalls within the CSA’s definition of\\nmarijuana into CSA schedule III. As is\\nthe case for marijuana under the Single\\nConvention, the controls available\\nunder CSA schedule III are sufficient to\\ncomply with the requirements of the\\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances\\nwith respect to D9-THC, although\\nadditional regulatory action may be\\nnecessary to implement certain\\nConvention requirements, such as the\\nexport and import authorizations\\nrequired by Article 12. See, e.g.,\\nSchedules of Controlled Substances:\\nRescheduling of the Food and Drug\\nAdministration Approved Product\\nContaining Synthetic Dronabinol [(-)-D 9\\n-(trans)-Tetrahydrocannabinol] in\\nSesame Oil and Encapsulated in Soft\\nGelatin Capsules From Schedule II to\\nSchedule III, 64 FR 35928, 35928 (July\\n2, 1999). Compare, e.g., Convention on\\nPsychotropic Substances art. 12(1)\\n(requiring export and import\\nauthorizations for substances in\\nConvention Schedule II), with 21 U.S.C.\\n952(b)(2) (authorizing import permits\\nfor CSA schedule III substances), and id.\\n953(e)(2) (authorizing export permits for\\nCSA schedule III substances).\\nAccordingly, concurrent with this\\nrulemaking, DEA will consider the\\nmarijuana-specific controls that would\\nbe necessary to meet U.S. obligations\\nunder the Single Convention and the\\nConvention on Psychotropic Substances\\nin the event that marijuana is\\nrescheduled to schedule III, and, to the\\nextent they are needed if marijuana is\\nrescheduled, will seek to finalize any\\nsuch regulations as soon as possible.\\nIX. Requirements for Handling\\nMarijuana and Other Applicable\\nControls\\nIf marijuana is transferred to schedule\\nIII, the regulatory controls applicable to\\nschedule III controlled substances\\nwould apply, as appropriate, along with\\nexisting marijuana-specific\\nrequirements and any additional\\ncontrols that might be implemented,\\nincluding those that might be\\nimplemented to meet U.S. treaty\\nobligations. The manufacture,\\ndistribution, dispensing, and possession\\nof marijuana would also remain subject\\nto applicable criminal prohibitions\\nunder the CSA. 21 U.S.C. 841–844.\\nIn addition, marijuana would remain\\nsubject to applicable provisions of the\\nFDCA. For example, under the FDCA, a\\ndrug containing a substance within the\\nCSA’s definition of ‘‘marijuana’’ would\\nneed FDA approval to be lawfully\\n‘‘introduce[d] or deliver[ed] for\\nintroduction into interstate commerce,’’\\nunless an IND is in effect for that drug.\\nSee 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 355(i), 331(d). To\\ndate, although there have been INDs for\\ndrugs containing a substance within the\\nCSA’s definition of ‘‘marijuana,’’ no\\nsuch drugs have been approved by FDA.\\nDOJ is seeking comment on the\\npractical consequences of rescheduling\\nmarijuana into schedule III under the\\nrelevant statutory frameworks.\\nConclusion\\nBased on the legal opinion of OLC\\nand consideration of the scientific and\\nmedical evaluation and accompanying\\nrecommendation of HHS, the Attorney\\nGeneral is initiating a rulemaking that\\nproposes the placement of marijuana in\\nschedule III of the CSA. DOJ is soliciting\\ncomments on this proposal.\\nX. Regulatory Analyses\\n1. Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory\\nPlanning and Review), 13563\\n(Improving Regulation and Regulatory\\nReview) and 14094 (Modernizing\\nRegulatory Review)\\nIn accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(a),\\nthis scheduling action is subject to\\nformal rulemaking procedures done ‘‘on\\nthe record after opportunity for a\\nhearing,’’ which are conducted pursuant\\nto the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and\\n557. The CSA sets forth the criteria for\\nremoving a drug or other substance from\\nthe list of controlled substances. Such\\nactions are exempt from review by the\\nOffice of Management and Budget\\npursuant to section 3(d)(1) of Executive\\nOrder 12866 and the principles\\nreaffirmed in Executive Order 13563\\nand 14094.\\nWhile this scheduling action is\\nexempt from review under Executive\\nOrder 12866, DOJ recognizes this action\\nmay have unique economic impacts. As\\nstated above, marijuana is subject to a\\nnumber of State laws that have allowed\\na multibillion dollar industry to\\ndevelop. DOJ acknowledges that there\\nmay be large impacts related to Federal\\ntaxes and research and development\\ninvestment for the pharmaceutical\\nindustry, among other things. DOJ is\\nspecifically soliciting comments on the\\neconomic impact of this proposed rule.\\nDOJ will revise this section at the final\\nrule stage if warranted after\\nconsideration of any comments\\nreceived.\\n2. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice\\nReform)\\nThis proposed regulation meets the\\napplicable standards set forth in\\nsections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive\\nOrder 12988 to eliminate drafting errors\\nand ambiguity, minimize litigation,\\nprovide a clear legal standard for\\naffected conduct, and promote\\nsimplification and burden reduction.\\n3. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism)\\nThis rulemaking does not have\\nfederalism implications warranting the\\napplication of Executive Order 13132.\\nThe rule does not have substantial\\ndirect effects on the States, on the\\nrelationship between the Federal\\nGovernment and the States, or the\\ndistribution of power and\\nresponsibilities among the various\\nlevels of government.\\n4. Executive Order 13175 (Consultation\\nand Coordination With Indian Tribal\\nGovernments)\\nThis proposed rule does not have\\nTribal implications warranting the\\napplication of Executive Order 13175.\\nThis rule does not have substantial\\ndirect effects on one or more Indian\\nTribes, on the relationship between the\\nFederal Government and Indian Tribes,\\nor on the distribution of power and\\nresponsibilities between the Federal\\nGovernment and Indian Tribes.\\n5. Regulatory Flexibility Act\\nDOJ has concluded that this action\\nmay have a significant economic impact\\non a substantial number of small entities\\nunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5\\nU.S.C. 601 et seq. For example, section\\n280E of the Internal Revenue Code bars\\nbusinesses from claiming tax deductions\\nfor otherwise allowable expenses where\\nthe business ‘‘consists of trafficking in\\ncontrolled substances (within the\\nmeaning of schedule I and II of the\\nControlled Substances Act).’’ 26 U.S.C.\\n280E.
