9–11 Response and Biometric EntryExit Fee for H–1B and L–1 Visas
AGENCY: U.S. Customs and Border
Protection, Department of Homeland
Security.
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.
SUMMARY: The Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) proposes to amend and
clarify the regulations concerning the 9–
11 Response & Biometric Entry-Exit Fee
for H–1B and L–1 Visas (9–11 Biometric
Fee). The proposed regulatory changes
would clarify DHS’s interpretation of
ambiguous statutory language to require
that covered employers submit the 9–11
Biometric Fee for all extension-of-stay
petitions, regardless of whether a Fraud
Fee applies, so as to include extensionof-stay petitions that do not involve a
change of employer. The 9–11 Biometric
Fee would continue to apply unchanged
to petitions seeking an initial grant of
status. The proposed changes will also
help DHS comply with its congressional
mandate to implement a biometric
entry-exit data system.
DATES: Comments must be received by
July 8, 2024.

II. Background
A. Statutory Authorization and History
1. Initial Supplemental H–1B and L–1
Fee
H–1B and L–1 classifications are
temporary nonimmigrant worker
classifications. H–1B and L–1
classifications are authorized under
sections 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) and (L),
respectively, of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA), as amended (8
U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), (L)). H–1B
status is a nonimmigrant classification
for noncitizens who work in certain
specialty services or occupations. L–1
status allows companies to seek a
temporary intracompany transfer of
certain noncitizen employees who
perform executive or managerial
functions or have specialized
knowledge.1
In 2010, Congress established a
supplemental fee for certain employers
petitioning for beneficiaries to obtain H–
1B or L–1 status (2010 Supplemental
Fee). See section 402 of the Act of
August 13, 2010, Public Law 111–230,
124 Stat. 2485, 2487 (Pub. L. 111–230)
(8 U.S.C. 1101 note). The 2010
Supplemental Fee applied to employers
that employ 50 or more employees in
the United States with more than 50
percent of the employees in the United
States in H–1B or L–1 nonimmigrant
status (covered employers). Sec. 402,
Public Law 111–230. The statute
required covered employers to pay an
increase to ‘‘the filing fee and fraud
prevention and detection fee’’ in the
amount of $2,000 or $2,250 for H–1B or
L–1 petitions, respectively. Sec. 402,
Public Law 111–230.
The statutory language in Public Law
111–230 required covered employers to
pay the 2010 Supplemental Fee at the
time that a fraud detection and
prevention fee (Fraud Fee) is collected.
Sec. 402, Public Law 111–230. The $500
Fraud Fee is established under separate
statutory authority. See sec. 426(a) of
the H–1B Visa Reform Act of 2004,
Public Law 108–447, 118 Stat. 2809,
3357 (the 2004 H–1B Visa Reform Act)
(8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(12)(A), section
214(c)(12)(A) of the INA). Pursuant to
section 426(b) of the 2004 H–1B Visa
Reform Act, the Department of State, in
collaboration with DHS and the
Department of Labor, uses Fraud Fee
collections to combat fraud in
immigration processes. 8 U.S.C.
1356(v)(2), section 286(v)(2) of the INA.
With limited exceptions, the statute
requires employers to pay the Fraud Fee
when petitioning for an initial grant of
H–1B or L–1 nonimmigrant status or for
change of employer petitions for
beneficiaries already in H–1B or L–1

3The 9–11 Biometric Fee is a fee related to
petitions for H–1B and L–1 classification and is
discussed in those terms in this proposed
rulemaking. Although not all those seeking H–1B
and L–1 classification are required to obtain a visa,
the headings in the statute refer to temporary fee
increases for H–1B and L–1 visas, and consequently
the headings in the implementing regulations refer
to fees for H–1B and L–1 visas. Accordingly, the
subject heading of this document and the proposed
regulatory headings also refer to fees for H–1B and
L–1 visas.

status. See sec. 426(a) of the 2004 H–1B
Visa Reform Act.
Although Public Law 111–230 could
reasonably be considered as ambiguous
because, among other things, it was not
clear whether the increased fee applied
once per covered petition or twice, that
is, as an increase to the petition fee and
separately as an increase to the Fraud
Fee, DHS interpreted the 2010
Supplemental Fee to apply only once
per covered petition and only when the
Fraud Fee applied. Accordingly, DHS
implemented regulations applying the
2010 Supplemental Fee to petitions
subject to the Fraud Fee seeking initial
grants of H–1B or L–1 status and change
of employer petitions for beneficiaries
already in H–1B or L–1 status,
consistent with applicability of the
Fraud Fee. See 76 FR 53764, 53768,
53781. The 2010 Supplemental Fee
sunset on September 30, 2015, after an
extension by Congress.2
2. 9–11 Response and Biometric EntryExit Fee
On December 18, 2015, Congress
established the ‘‘9–11 Response and
Biometric Entry-Exit Fee’’ for certain H–
1B and L–1 petitions (9–11 Biometric
Fee). See Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2016, Div. O, sec. 402(g), Public
Law 114–113, 129 Stat. 2242, 3006 (Pub.
L. 114–113) (49 U.S.C. 40101 note).3
Public Law 114–113 instated the 9–11
Biometric Fee after the 2010
Supplemental Fee expired. The amount
of the 2010 Supplemental Fee was
doubled for the 9–11 Biometric Fee to
be $4,000 and $4,500 for H–1B and L–
1 petitions, respectively. Id. At the same
time, Congress also established the 9–11
Response and Biometric Exit Account
(9–11 Biometric Account), into which
50 percent of the funds from the 9–11
Biometric Fee collections are deposited,
up to $1 billion. Id. DHS may use the
funds available in the 9–11 Biometric
Account to implement the biometric
entry and exit data system required by
section 7208 of the Intelligence Reform
and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004,
Public Law 108–458, 118 Stat. 3638,
3817 (IRTPA), (8 U.S.C. 1365b). Sec.
402(g), Public Law 114–113. Section
7208 of the IRTPA (8 U.S.C. 1365b),
adopting recommendations by the
National Commission on Terrorist
Attacks Upon the United States (also
known as the 9/11 Commission),
requires DHS to implement a biometric
entry-exit system that uses biometric
data to confirm the identity of travelers
entering and exiting the United States.
As the DHS component responsible for
controlling the border and monitoring
the arrival and departure of U.S. citizens
and noncitizens, CBP implements
biometric operations in the land, sea,
and air environments.4 Pursuant to
congressional extension, the 9–11
Biometric Fee is currently set to expire
on September 30, 2027.5
The statutory language establishing
the 9–11 Biometric Fee is similar to that
of Public Law 111–230. However, Public
Law 114–113 has two important
distinctions, beyond the increased fee
amounts. First, Congress added the
word ‘‘combined,’’ thereby resolving a
potential ambiguity that existed in
Public Law 111–230 and clarifying that
the fee increase served as a single fee
increase rather than as separate fee
increases to both the filing fee and the
Fraud Fee. Sec. 402(g), Public Law 114–
113. Second, with respect to the types
of petitions for which the fees must be
submitted, Congress inserted the phrase
‘‘including an application for an
extension of such status.’’ Id. This
addition clarified that the 9–11
Biometric Fee is required for both
petitions seeking an initial grant of
status and extension-of-stay petitions.
B. Prior DHS Rulemaking Addressing
the 9–11 Biometric Fee
Although the statutory changes
discussed above clarified some of the
ambiguous language in Public Law 111–
230, the new legislation, Public Law
114–113, could still be reasonably
considered ambiguous concerning the
issue of whether covered employers
filing extension-of-stay petitions must
pay the 9–11 Biometric Fee for all
extension petitions or only those
involving a change in employer. At the
time that the 9–11 Biometric Fee was
established in 2015, DHS interpreted the
new language in Public Law 114–113
consistent with its prior interpretation;
that is, the 9–11 Biometric Fee only
applies when the Fraud Fee also
applies. Accordingly, DHS implemented
regulations in a final rule published on
October 24, 2016 (2016 Fee Rule) that
set forth its interpretation. See 81 FR
73292.
In the years following the 2016 Fee
Rule, DHS monitored the collection of
the 9–11 Biometric Fee and evaluated
other permissible interpretations of the
ambiguous statutory language in Public
Law 114–113. After careful
consideration, on November 14, 2019,
DHS proposed an interpretation
expanding the circumstances in which
the 9–11 Biometric Fee would apply
(2019 Fee NPRM), as well as proposing
numerous other changes related to fees
collected by DHS. 84 FR 62280. DHS
received several comments on the 2019
Fee NPRM opposing the proposed 9–11
Biometric Fee. After considering the
comments, on August 3, 2020, DHS
adopted the 9–11 Biometric Fee
interpretation that would require the
additional fee for all H–1B or L–1
extension of stay petitions filed by
covered employers, among other
changes, in a Final Rule (2020 Fee
Rule). See 85 FR 46788. For additional
information on the comments and DHS’
responses, see the 2020 Fee rule at 85
FR 46866. However, before the 2020 Fee
Rule could go into effect, it was
enjoined in its entirety during the
course of litigation unrelated to the 9–
11 Biometric Fee.6 Accordingly, DHS
never changed its collection practices
regarding the 9–11 Biometric Fee and
currently collects the 9–11 Biometric
Fee only for petitions filed by covered
employers seeking initial grants of H–1B
or L–1 status or change of employer
petitions filed by covered employers for
beneficiaries already in H–1B or L–1
status, including change of employer
petitions requesting an extension of

7Although the 2020 Fee Rule was enjoined prior
to its effective date, the regulatory language at 8
CFR 106.2(c)(8)–(9) was revised in 2020 to reflect
the changes adopted in the 2020 Fee Rule. 85 FR
46788. On January 31, 2024, DHS published a final
rule replacing the language at 8 CFR 106.2(c)(8)–(9)
with the pre-2020 Fee Rule version of the
regulations in order to align the regulations with
DHS practice in light of the injunction on the 2020
Fee Rule (2024 Final Rule). 89 FR 6194. In the 2024
Final Rule, DHS noted that the 9–11 Biometric Fee
may be the subject of a future rulemaking. Id at
6240.
8Section 402(g) of Public Law 114–113 provides
that DHS may draw from the 9–11 Biometric
Account to implement the biometric entry-exit data
system as required by Congress. DHS directs these
funds to CBP because CBP is the agency ultimately
responsible for implementing the biometric entryexit data system. See secs. 411(c)(10), (g)(3) of the
HSA (6 U.S.C. 211(c)(10), (g)(3)); sec. 7208 of the
IRTPA (8 U.S.C. 1365b).

such status, but not for other extension
of stay requests.7
III. Purpose of 9–11 Biometric Fee and
Need for Rulemaking
A. The Purpose of the 9–11 Biometric
Fee
In Public Law 114–113, Congress
expressly intended for the 9–11
Biometric Fee to fund the biometric
entry and exit programs it mandated
earlier in order to improve security,
combat visa and travel document fraud,
and protect our country against
terrorism. As discussed above, Congress
enacted the IRTPA in 2004 and
implemented recommendations made
by the 9/11 Commission. See Tit. VII of
the IRTPA. Section 7208 of the IRTPA
(8 U.S.C. 1365b) requires DHS to
implement a biometric entry and exit
data system. Congress expressed in the
IRTPA that a biometric entry-exit data
system is ‘‘an essential investment in
efforts to protect the United States by
preventing the entry of terrorists.’’ Sec.
7208(a) of the IRTPA (8 U.S.C.
1365b(a)). Moreover, the IRTPA
explicitly highlights certain goals for
DHS and the biometric entry-exit system
in addition to serving as a vital
counterterrorism mechanism, which
include efficiently screening travelers,
integrating and modifying relevant
databases to address increased volume
and usage, and improving database
search capacities. Sec. 7208(h) of the
IRTPA (8 U.S.C. 1365b(h)).
In 2015, Congress established the 9–
11 Biometric Account for the purpose of
funding the biometric entry-exit system
that Congress mandated in the IRTPA.
Sec. 402(g), Public Law 114–113.
Congress also implemented the 9–11
Biometric Fee, which replaced and
doubled the expired 2010 Supplemental
Fee, in order to fund the 9–11 Biometric
Account and, by extension, DHS’s
biometric entry-exit data system. DHS
believes the interpretation of Public Law
114–113 proposed in this rulemaking
would better align the regulations with
legislative intent and better enable DHS
to meet its congressional mandates.
CBP is the primary DHS component
responsible for implementing an
integrated, automated entry-exit system
that matches the biographic data and
biometric information of noncitizens
entering and departing the United States
at land, sea, and air points of entry. See
sec. 411(c)(10) of the HSA (6 U.S.C.
211(c)(10)); sec. 7208 of the IRTPA (8
U.S.C. 1365b). Pursuant to CBP’s
mission to control the border and
regulate the arrival and departure of
both U.S. citizens and noncitizens, CBP
has the authority to confirm the identity
of all travelers and verify that the
travelers are the authorized bearers of
their travel documents. See sec. 411 of
the HSA (6 U.S.C. 211); and 8 CFR
235.1. An integrated biometric entryexit system has provided the most
accurate way to verify an individual’s
identity. By operating these systems,
CBP can therefore improve security and
effectively combat attempts by terrorists
who use false travel documents to
circumvent border checkpoints. Further,
biometrically verifying that a person
who presents a travel document is the
true bearer of that document helps to
prevent visa and immigration fraud and
the fraudulent use of legitimate travel
documentation.
The funding that DHS receives from
the 9–11 Biometric Account supports
critical biometric entry-exit operations
in the land, sea, and air entry
environments that are ongoing and must
be sustained in order to continue their
use.8 Specifically, the 9–11 Biometric
Account buttresses the development,
operations, and maintenance of the
Traveler Verification Service (TVS).9
TVS is the facial comparison matching
service that serves as the backbone of
CBP’s biometric entry-exit data
system.10 TVS effectively and efficiently
matches passengers to the travel
documents they present to CBP.11
Maintaining TVS enables CBP to
continue preserving the United States’
crucial health, operational, and national
security interests.12
DHS’s biometric entry-exit data
system also directly and positively
affects the travel industry by restoring
consumer confidence in travel safety.
Using biometric technology, air and sea
partners can facilitate check-in, security,
and boarding processes that historically
involved long lines, heavy personal
interaction, and frequent handling of
travel documents. The implementation
of biometric technology, namely facial
comparison, in all travel environments
encourages contactless travel that
involves minimal physical contact,
which is more efficient and increases
the safety of travelers, CBP officers, and
port personnel.
In addition to streamlining travel and
restoring consumer confidence, the use
of facial biometric matching protects the
identity of travelers and provides
another layer of security. TVS reduces
the number of times that travelers must
show their travel documents, which
contain personally identifiable
information, to government and carrier
personnel throughout both entry and
exit processes. The use of facial
biometric matching has also proven to
be an effective tool in combatting the
use of stolen and fraudulent travel and
identity documents. Since the program’s
inception in 2018, CBP officers at U.S.
airports have successfully intercepted
77 impostors who were denied
admission to the United States and
identified 1,806 imposters on arrival in
the land pedestrian environment.
Further, since June 2017 through
December 5, 2023, DHS has confirmed
over 304,004 overstays through the use
of facial biometric matching at exit.13
DHS’s current biometric entry-exit
operations have proven successful in
enhancing national security and public
safety.14 Ultimately, lack of adequate
funding poses a dire threat to DHS’s
mission, CBP officers, and public safety.
Without the proposed regulatory
changes to the collection of the 9–11
Biometrics Fee, DHS cannot maintain its
current biometric entry operations or
continue implementing other essential

15 ‘‘Covered employers’’ are those employers with
more than 50 employees in the United States and
where more than 50 percent of the employees in the
United States are in H–1B or L–1 nonimmigrant
status. Sec. 420(g), Public Law 114–113.
16See USCIS, Fee Increase for Certain H–1B and
L–1 Petitions (Pub. L. 114–113), https://

17 Individual L–1 petitions (Form I–129S) filed on
the basis of a previously approved ‘‘blanket L’’
petition are currently subject to the Fraud Fee and,
by extension, the 9–11 Biometric Fee. USCIS
already considers this a change of employer, even
if the petitioner is covered under the same ‘‘blanket
L’’ approval as the previous petitioner. Therefore,
the proposed changes will not alter current USCIS
practice in this regard.

calculations are not available for L–1 petitions.
entry and exit programs. Failure to
maintain or continue implementing
DHS’s biometric entry and exit
operations increases risks to security
vulnerabilities, interoperability and data
management issues, cyber resilience in
the event of a cyberattack from criminal
hackers, system availability and
reliability, and system scalability to
meet the demands of travel partners.
The 9–11 Biometric Fee is essential to
funding these biometric entry-exit
programs, and the regulations proposed
will directly support DHS’s fulfilment of
its congressional mandates.
B. Need for Rulemaking
DHS must interpret ambiguous
statutory language to implement the
responsibilities that Congress has
assigned to the agency. The language in
Public Law 114–113 establishing the 9–
11 Biometric Fee is ambiguous
regarding the fee’s applicability to
extension-of-stay petitions. DHS must
therefore resolve the statutory ambiguity
to determine whether the 9–11
Biometric Fee applies to all extensionof-stay petitions by covered
employers.15 As discussed above, Public
Law 114–113 established the 9–11
Biometric Fee by again enacting and
doubling the 2010 Supplemental Fee to
be $4,000 for H–1B petitions and $4,500
for L–1 petitions. Congress also added
new phrasing in two pertinent places
that guided the Department’s proposed
interpretation: ‘‘. . . the combined filing
fee and [Fraud Fee] required to be
submitted with an application for
admission [as an H–1B or L
nonimmigrant], including an
application for an extension of such
status, shall be increased.’’ Sec. 402(g),
Public Law 114–113 (emphasis added).
Previously, DHS had to determine
whether the 9–11 Biometric Fee applies
to all extension petitions by covered
employers or just those for which the
Fraud Fee is also charged (change of
employer petitions for a beneficiary
already in H–1B or L–1 status, including
a change of employer petition that
requests an extension of such status). In
2016, DHS interpreted the 9–11
Biometric Fee to apply only when the
Fraud Fee also applied. 81 FR 73292. In
2019, DHS considered that applying the
9–11 Biometric Fee to all extension
petitions would be a significant new
substantive expansion of the 9–11
Biometric Fee compared to the
interpretation that DHS adopted from
2010–2015 for the 2010 Supplemental
Fee. At that time, DHS considered the
latter reading would be consistent with
the scope of the 2010 Supplemental Fee
(although in the higher amounts
provided by Pub. L. 114–113). See 2019
Fee NRPM, 84 FR 62280, 62322.
The construction of the statutory
ambiguity in Public Law 114–113 that
DHS adopted in 2016 was not, however,
the only reasonable one. Another
reasonable interpretation of that statute
is that the 9–11 Biometric Fee applies to
all extension of stay petitions even
when the Fraud Fee is not applicable.
Under this alternative interpretation of
Public Law 114–113, the language
‘‘including an application for an
extension of such status’’ is a
substantive amendment, and the
insertion of the word ‘‘combined’’ is a
clarifying one. It is plausible that
Congress added the reference to
extension of status so that the 9–11
Biometric Fee would be collected for all
extension of stay petitions, not just
those where a change of employer is
also requested. Under this
interpretation, the insertion of the word
‘‘combined’’ can be viewed as a
clarifying edit that the increase to the
fee is applied only once per petition and
not once for the filing fee and once for
the Fraud Fee such that it might apply
two times for some petitions. In that
case, a covered employer would pay the
filing fee plus the Fraud Fee plus the
applicable 9–11 Biometric Fee ($4,000
for H–1B petitions or $4,500 for L–1
petitions). When the Fraud Fee does not
apply, the ‘‘combined filing fee and
[Fraud Fee]’’ is simply the filing fee plus
$0, such that covered employers would
pay the filing fee + $0 for the Fraud Fee
+ the applicable 9–11 Biometric Fee.
This interpretation would give meaning
to all of Congress’s alterations to the
earlier statute.
Following the passage of Public Law
114–113, DHS considered alternative
interpretations of the ambiguous
language, but ultimately decided, at that
time, to maintain its earlier
interpretation, that the 9–11 Biometric
Fee applies only when the Fraud Fee
applies. DHS internally noted that
alternative interpretations were also
reasonable but chose to maintain the
status quo for that time while internally
reviewing alternative interpretations.
See 2019 Fee NRPM, 84 FR 62280,
62322. DHS has reexamined this matter
and believes that its alternative
interpretation of Public Law 114–113,
proposed here, is more consistent with
the goal of the statute to ensure
employers that employ a substantial
number of H–1B or L–1 nonimmigrant
workers pay an additional fee by making
the 9–11 Biometric Fee applicable to all
petitions by covered employers,
regardless of whether or not the Fraud
Fee also applies. In other words, the 9–
11 Biometric Fee should apply to all H–
1B or L–1 petitions filed by covered
employers seeking initial classification
of a beneficiary as an H–1B or L–1
nonimmigrant or an extension of stay
for those already in such status,
irrespective whether the extension of
stay request is for a change of covered
employers or for the purpose of
remaining employed with the original
covered employer.
In addition to putting forth a
permissible interpretation of Public Law
114–113, DHS is also affirming that the
interpretation in this rulemaking more
closely aligns with Congress’s objective
to require an additional fee for covered
employers, who by definition rely on H–
1B and L–1 nonimmigrants for 50
percent of their workforce.16
Accordingly, a reasonable interpretation
of Public Law 114–113 is that Congress
intended for covered employers to pay
the 9–11 Biometric Fee even when the
beneficiaries remain with the same
employer. Without this proposed
change, covered employers can avoid
paying the 9–11 Biometric Fee while
employing a substantial number of H–
1B and L–1 nonimmigrants as long as
the beneficiary remains employed by
the same covered employer.17 The
ability of these petitioners to avoid
paying the 9–11 fee entirely in some
cases would appear to be against the
Congressional intent in establishing
these fees. From fiscal year 2018 to
fiscal year 2022, 29 percent of all H–1B
petitions were subject to the 9–11
Biometric Fee. Had this rule been in
effect for that same time period, the
percentage of H–1B petitions that would
have been subject to the 9–11 Biometric
Fee would have been 84 percent of all
H–1B petitions.18
Significantly, a delay in this
additional funding will continue to
jeopardize CBP’s ability to meet its
congressional mandate to enhance
national security by deploying a fully
integrated biometric entry-exit data

19Since 2004, DHS has worked to develop and
implement a comprehensive biometric entry and
exit data system as required by section 7208 of the
IRTPA. See, e.g., Implementation of the United
States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator
Technology Program (‘‘US–VISIT’’); Biometric
Requirements, 69 FR 468 (Jan. 5, 2004). Additional

biometric operations are DHS’s annual Entry/Exit

21FY 2018–2021 data are based on data provided
by USCIS via email between 11/30/2021 and 12/21/
2021.
22FY 2018–2021 data are based on data provided
by USCIS via email between 11/30/2021 and 12/21/
2021. The collection totals for FYs 2020 and 2021
were $72 million and $57 million, respectively.
DHS recognizes the impact COVID–19 had on
collection totals during this time frame but
emphasizes that collection totals fell short of
estimated collections prior to the COVID–19
pandemic.
23As stated previously, 8 CFR part 106 and the
other regulatory changes in the 2020 Fee Rule have
been codified although DHS is enjoined from
implementing or enforcing them and is still
charging the fees as set forth in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1)
as they existed prior to the 2020 Fee Rule. DHS is
proposing in this rule to replace the enjoined
provisions at 8 CFR 106.2(c)(7) and (8) pertaining
to the 9–11 Biometric Fees. The 9–11 Biometric Fee
provisions are proposed at 8 CFR 106.2(c)(8) and (9)
in the 2023 Fee NPRM, and so are proposed as such
here.
24 ‘‘Covered employers’’ are those employers with
more than 50 employees in the United States and
where more than 50 percent of the employees in the
United States are in H–1B or L–1 nonimmigrant
status. Sec. 402(g), Public Law 114–113.
system. Without additional funding,
CBP will be unable to maintain its
current biometric entry operations, as
well as ensure that TVS continues to be
available to CBP and external
stakeholders. CBP will also be unable to
expand biometric confirmation to
additional sea and land modalities at
points of entry to the United States and
fully implement a comprehensive
biometric exit system at all land, sea,
and air exits.19
Actual collections have fallen short of
both anticipated collections and what is
necessary to maintain and expand
biometric operations. In December 2015,
the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
published a report on the fee provisions
in Public Law 114–113 and estimated
annual revenues of $420 million per
year (except for $380 million in the first
year of FY 2016) from the 9–11
Biometric Fee through its lifespan.20
Pursuant to the statute, 50 percent of
those annual total collections—or an
estimated $210 million per year—would
be deposited into the 9–11 Biometric
Account and made available to DHS and
CBP, up to $1 billion. However, actual
collections pre–COVID–19 repeatedly
fell well below CBO’s estimates: $158
million in FY 2016, $125 million in FY
2017, $119 million in FY 2018, and
$118 million in FY 2019.21
Notwithstanding the impact of COVID–
19 on collections during FYs 2020–21,22
DHS believes that collections have
fallen short of CBO projections
primarily because the current statutory
interpretation fails to apply the 9–11
Biometric Fee to all extension petitions
regardless of whether there is a change
of employer. Both the previous
interpretation and the current
interpretation of Public Law 114–113
are reasonable based on the wording in
the statute; therefore, DHS is proposing
to amend the regulations to better align
with its Congressional mandate to
implement a fully integrated biometric
entry-exit system.
IV. Proposed Changes to Regulations
A. Proposed Amendment to Collection
of 9–11 Biometric Fees
DHS proposes to amend the
regulations at 8 CFR 106.2(c)(8) and (9)
to specify that the 9–11 Biometric Fee
will apply to all H–1B and L–1
extension-of-stay petitions in addition
to all previously covered H–1B and L–
1 petitions.23 Accordingly, DHS
proposes to replace the phrase ‘‘certain
petitioners’’ with ‘‘all petitioners’’ in the
subparagraphs concerning both H–1B
and L–1 petitioners. This proposed
change will allow DHS to charge all
covered petitioners the 9–11 Biometric
Fee, including those seeking extension
petitions that do not involve a change of
employer, as opposed to only those
petitioners whose petitions are also
subject to the Fraud Fee.
B. Proposed Clarifying Amendments
DHS also proposes certain clarifying
amendments. First, DHS proposes to
insert the phrase ‘‘except for petitioners
filing an amended petition without an
extension of stay request.’’ Amended
petitions are filed to notify USCIS of a
material change in the terms or
conditions of employment or the
beneficiary’s eligibility as specified in
the original approved petition. See
USCIS, Form I–129, Instructions for
Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker,
https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/
files/document/forms/i-129instr.pdf.
Under the proposed regulations,
covered petitioners filing an H–1B or L–
1 amended petition that does not
include an extension of stay request
would not be required to submit the 9–
11 Biometric Fee.
DHS further proposes to clarify the
method by which it determines whether
a petitioner is a covered employer.
Currently, DHS counts all full-time and
part-time employees who hold H–1B or
L–1 status in order to determine
whether an employer meets the
definition of ‘‘covered employer’’ by
reaching the 50 percent threshold. DHS
requires the 9–11 Biometric Fee once
the threshold is met to be considered a
covered employer. DHS proposes
adding the words ‘‘in the aggregate’’ to
both provisions in 8 CFR 106.2(c)(8) and
(9) to clarify its current practice.
V. Statutory and Regulatory Reviews
A. Executive Orders 12866, 14094, and
13563
Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review), as amended by
Executive Order 14094 (Modernizing
Regulatory Review), and Executive
Order 13563 (Improving Regulation and
Regulatory Review) direct agencies to
assess the costs and benefits of available
regulatory alternatives and, if regulation
is necessary, to select regulatory
approaches that maximize net benefits
(including potential economic,
environmental, public health and safety
effects, distributive impacts, and
equity). Executive Order 13563
emphasizes the importance of
quantifying both costs and benefits,
reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and
promoting flexibility.
The Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) has not designated this proposed
rule a significant regulatory action
under section 3(f) of Executive Order
12866, as amended by Executive Order
14094. Accordingly, OMB has not
reviewed this proposed rule.
As a result of this rule, DHS expects
H–1B and L–1 transfer payments from
fee payers to the U.S. Government to
increase by a combined total of $157.3
million annually. This will ensure that
covered employers 24 would have to pay
the 9–11 Biometric Fee as well as
increase funds to implement and
maintain CBP’s biometrics programs.
Public Law 114–113 exempts employers
that do not employ 50 or more
employees with more than 50 percent of
employees under H–1B and/or L–1
status from the 9–11 Biometric Fee.
1. Purpose of the Rule
In 2020, after evaluating alternative
interpretations of Public Law 114–113,
DHS adopted the 2020 Fee Rule, which
made the 9–11 Biometric Fee applicable
to all petitions by covered employers,
except for amended petitions without an
extension of stay request, regardless of
whether the Fraud Fee also applies.
DHS believes that Congress’s intent with
the 9–11 Biometric Fee was twofold.
First, to ensure that covered employers

(establishing the initial sunset date for the 9–11
Biometric Fee as September 30, 2025), as amended
by sec. 30203(b) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of
2018, Public Law 115–123, 132 Stat. 64, 126

by USCIS via email between 11/30/2021 and 12/21/

would generally have to pay an
additional fee of $4,000 or $4,500 for H–
1B or L–1 petitions, respectively.
Second, to fund congressionally
mandated biometric entry and exit
programs that protect against terrorism.
However, the interpretation that DHS
adopted in the 2020 Fee Rule never
went into effect because the 2020 Fee
Rule was enjoined in its entirety during
litigation unrelated to the 9–11
Biometric Fee. DHS maintains that the
interpretation adopted in the 2020 Fee
Rule is most consistent with the
statute’s goals. Therefore, DHS is
proposing to adopt regulations that
better align with Congress’s intent for
Public Law 114–113. The proposed
change would expand the instances in
which the 9–11 Biometric Fee applies
by applying the 9–11 Biometric Fee to
all H–1B or L–1 petitions seeking initial
grants of status or an extension of stay,
regardless of whether the Fraud Fee
applies. By implementing this
alternative interpretation of ambiguous
language in Public Law 114–113, DHS is
effectuating Congressional intent
because the increased collections will
provide necessary funds for the
implementation and maintenance of
biometric entry and exit data systems as
required by Congress under section
7208 of the IRTPA.
CBP is responsible for implementing
an integrated and automated entry-exit
system that matches biographic data and
biometrics of noncitizens entering and
departing the United States. CBP
currently relies on the 9–11 Biometric
Fee to fund several processes and
programs such as TVS, which benefit
the public by increasing consumer
confidence in travel safety and speeding
up the boarding process while
encouraging contactless travel. CBP’s
use of biometrics has also proven to be
effective in combatting the use of stolen
and fraudulently presented travel and
identity documents. The 9–11 Biometric
Fee funds biometrics programs that also
benefit other government agencies by
providing assurance that the travelers
arriving match their travel documents.
2. Transfer Payments From Rule
Fees paid to government agencies for
goods and services provided by the
agency are considered transfer payments
because they are monetary payments
from payers to the government and do
not affect the total resources available to
society. Costs associated with the
provision of these goods and services
are considered government costs of the
regulation. Therefore, in this regulatory
impact analysis, DHS discusses the
additional transfer payments that H–1B
and L–1 petitioners will experience as a
result of this rule in qualitative, and
when possible, quantitative, and
monetized terms. This analysis
evaluates the impact on transfer
payments for H–1B petitions and L–1
petitions separately due to the
differences in fee amounts and the data
available. The period of analysis is for
fiscal years (FY) 2023–2027. CBP bases
its estimates on data from FY 2018–2022
due to data limitations.25
Currently, of the H–1B and L–1
petitions submitted by covered
employers, only those requesting new
employment or a change of employer
are required to pay the 9–11 Biometric
Fee. This rule will increase transfer
payments from H–1B and L–1
petitioners by also applying the 9–11
Biometric Fee to H–1B and L–1
extension-of-stay petitions filed by
covered employers.
The H–1B submissions currently
subject to the 9–11 Biometric Fee and
the resulting transfer payments are
shown in Table 1.26 Projected annual
submissions are an average of
submissions from FY 2018–2022.
Multiplying the projected submissions
by the fee amount of $4,000 provides
the projected annual transfer payments
in the baseline. Transfer payments
shown in Table 1 are not a result of this
rule and are not added to those in Table
2 when totaling the additional transfer
payments as a result of this rule; these
fee payments are already occurring in
the baseline. The values of Table 1 and
Table 2 can be added together for an
estimate of the total petitions subject to
the 9–11 Biometric Fee and the transfer
payments for covered H–1B employers
under this rule.

• Fee requirements are not changing for these categories under this rule.
• Projected submissions for 2023–2027 are based on the average of submissions for 2018–2022 rounded up.
• Total Actual Transfer Payments differ from expected values based on calculations (Total Submissions × Fee Amount) due to differences in
the timing of filings and when collections take place.
Table 2 shows the number of

which the 9–11 Biometric Fee would

rule. As done in Table 1, the projected

submissions and multiplying the
projected submissions by the $4,000 fee
provides the projected annual transfer

• The categories listed in this table are based on options for question 2 in part 2 of Form I–129.
• The 9–11 Biometric Fee is only applicable to petitions in these categories which also include an extension of stay request and do not reflect
the total number of petitions received.
• The 9–11 Biometric Fee was not required for submissions pursuant to the categories listed this table for 2018–2022.
• Projected submissions for 2023–2027 are based on the average of submissions for 2018–2022 rounded up.
The numbers of H–1B petitions
shown in Table 1 are based on
petitioners’ responses to Form I–129
Part 2, Questions 2 and 4, indicating the
purpose of the request was New
Employment or a Change of Employer.
DHS assumes that petitioners newly
required to pay the 9–11 Biometric Fee
as a result of this rule will continue
participating in the H–1B and L–1
programs at their current rate because
this is a known fee and an expected cost
of participation in the program. Similar
information collected in L Classification
Supplement Items 4.a and 4.b is not
preserved in USCIS’s administrative
data. Consequently, DHS estimates the
number of L–1 petitions with 50 or more
employees and more than 50 percent of
employees in H–1B/L–1 status that are
currently subject to the fee by dividing
the L–1 collections deposited in the CBP
and Treasury accounts by the $4,500 fee
amount, as shown in Table 3. Due to the
lack of data regarding L Classification
Supplement Items 4.a and 4.b, DHS
estimated the projected submissions
that will be subject to the fee as a result
of this proposed rule by calculating the
ratio of H–1B submissions newly subject
to the fee to the H–1B submissions
currently subject to the fee for FY 2018–
2022. This multiplier (1.8929) was then
applied to the number of projected L–
1 submissions subject to the fee to find
the projected L–1 submissions newly
subject to the fee as a result of this rule
and is shown in Table 3. This
methodology assumes that the ratio of
new fee payers to baseline fee payers is
the same for L–1 and H–1B. To the
extent it differs, the transfers will be
higher or lower than projected. We
request comment on this assumption.

• L–1 submissions were calculated by dividing the actual transfer payments by the fee amount for FY 2018–2022.
• The 9–11 Biometric Fee is only applicable to petitions which also include an extension of stay request and do not reflect the total number of
petitions received.
• Projected submissions currently subject to fee for 2023–2027 are based on the average of submissions for 2018–2022.
• Projected L–1 submissions newly subject to fee are calculated using the ratio of H–1B submissions newly subject to fee to H–1B submissions currently subject to fee from 2018–2022 (a multiplier of 1.8929).
In undiscounted 2022 dollars, DHS
believes this rule will result in a

With this additional funding CBP will
be able to meet its congressional
mandate to enhance national security by
deploying a fully integrated biometric
entry-exit data system. CBP will be able
to maintain its current biometric entry
and exit operations, as well as ensure
that TVS continues to be available to
CBP and external stakeholders. CBP will
also be able to continue its expansion to
all ports of entry in order to fully
implement a comprehensive biometric
exit system at all land, sea, and air
exits.27
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5
U.S.C. 601 et. seq.) (RFA), as amended
by the Small Business Regulatory
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
(SBREFA), requires agencies to assess
the impact of regulations on small
entities. A small entity may be a small
business (defined as any independently
owned and operated business not
dominant in its field that qualifies as a
small business per the Small Business
Act); a small not-for-profit organization;
or a small governmental jurisdiction
(locality with fewer than 50,000 people).
As discussed above, this rule will
result in transfer payments to the U.S.
Government from employers with 50 or
more employees and more than 50
percent of employees in H–1B and/or L–
1 nonimmigrant status (covered
employers). DHS used a random sample
of 399 H–1B/L–1 petitioners provided
by USCIS to positively identify 264
small entities based on the size
standards of the Small Business
Administration. Only 41 of these small
entities have more than 50 employees
and would be subject to the 9–11
Biometric Fee. The rule also states that
the 9–11 Biometric Fee is applicable
only to entities with more than 50
percent of employees in H–1B or L–1
status. DHS does not have enough
information to determine how many
employers fit this description.
Therefore, DHS is unable to determine
whether this rule affects a substantial
number of small businesses. However,
DHS can estimate that an approximate
maximum of 16 percent of small
businesses will be affected by this
rule.28
Petitioning employers with 50 or
more employees and more than 50
percent of employees in H–1B or L–1
status will pay the 9–11 Biometric Fee.
The fee for H–1B and L–1 petitions
under Public Law 114–113 is $4,000
and $4,500, respectively. DHS does not
have enough information on the number
of times a petitioning employer would
pay the 9–11 Biometric Fee due to the
rule change to determine whether this
rule has a significant impact on small
businesses.
Although DHS was able to estimate
effects of the rule and create a rough
estimate of the number of small
businesses affected by the rule, DHS
was unable to determine how many
employers have more than 50 percent of
its employees in the United States in H–
1B or L–1 nonimmigrant status, or the
number of times that an individual
employer would be subject to the 9–11
Biometric Fee due to a lack of detailed
petition data available on filings.
Therefore, DHS seeks public comment
on the number of small companies that
would be subject to this fee and how
often small companies would pay the 9–
11 Biometric Fee. DHS has conducted
the following Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis.
1. A Description of the Reasons Why
Action by the Agency Is Being
Considered
DHS is proposing to amend
regulations to implement an

Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 110 / Thursday, June 6, 2024 / Proposed Rules 48347
interpretation of the statutory language
in Public Law 114–113 that DHS now
believes would better align with
congressional intent by expanding the
instances in which the 9–11 Biometric
Fee would apply. DHS believes this
interpretation and the consequent
increased collections would better
enable DHS to comply with its
congressional mandate under section
7208 of the IRTPA to implement and
maintain biometric entry and exit data.
2. A Succinct Statement of the
Objectives of, and Legal Basis for, the
Proposed Rule
The 9–11 Biometric Fee is authorized
under Div. O, section 402(g) of the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016,
Public Law 114–113, 129 Stat. 2242,
3006. This statute set aside 50 percent
of the funds that come from the 9–11
Biometric Fee (up to a total of $1
billion) to be deposited into a 9–11
Biometric Account. The funds from the
9–11 Biometric Account are available to
support the congressionally mandated
biometric entry-exit data system, as
described under section 7208 of the
IRTPA. Annual maintenance costs for
those biometric entry and exit data
systems that CBP has already
implemented currently exceed the
annual funding received through the 9–
11 Biometric Fee. These funds are
insufficient to finish implementing the
biometric entry operations to additional
sea and land modalities or to implement
a comprehensive biometric exit system.
DHS believes this proposed rule will
increase collections and provide
adequate funding to better allow CBP to
meet Congress’s biometric programs
mandate and would better align with
congressional intent.
3. A Description and, Where Feasible,
an Estimate of the Number of Small
Entities to Which the Proposed Rule
Will Apply
The proposed rule could potentially
affect small, covered employers across a
wide range of industries. CBP used a
random sample of 399 H–1B and L–1
petitioners in 2020 to estimate the
number of small entities affected by this
rule. Table 6 shows the distribution of
entities across the sample provided by
USCIS. From this sample, six entities
listed an invalid North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS)
code and 68 did not report a NAICS
code, and so CBP cannot make a
determination on the size of the entity
or the impact this rule will have on
them. Of the remaining 325 entities in
the sample, CBP was able to positively
identify 264 as small entities based on
size standards of the Small Business
Administration. Table 6 shows the
distribution of small entities across
industries.

Of the 264 confirmed small entities,

would be statutorily exempt from
paying the 9–11 Biometric Fee and 40

employees. CBP did not have an
employee count for one employer and
cannot determine whether it is affected
by this rule.

29 ‘‘50/50 threshold’’ refers to the threshold for
employers to be subject to the requirements of the
9–11 Biometric Fee. Employers with 50 or more

(41/264 = .1553 or 15.53%).
Based on the sample and the 50/50
threshold,29 CBP estimates that an
approximate maximum of 16 percent of
small entities that hire H–1B or L–1
employees will be affected by this
rule.30
4. A Description of the Projected
Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other
Compliance Requirements of the
Proposed Rule, Including an Estimate of
the Classes of Small Entities Which Will
Be Subject to the Requirement and the
Type of Professional Skills Necessary
for Preparation of the Report or Record
The proposed regulation does not
propose changes to any required
reporting or recordkeeping. As
discussed above, this rule could affect
any small entity that employs 50 or
more people with more than 50 percent
of employees in H–1B or L–1
nonimmigrant status.
The proposed rule would have
compliance requirements for affected
small businesses since it would amend
the regulations at 8 CFR 106.2(c)(8) and
(9) to specify that the 9–11 Biometric
Fee will apply to all H–1B and L–1
extension-of-stay petitions in addition
to all previously covered H–1B and L–
1 petition. As a result, petitioning small
businesses with 50 or more employees
and more than 50 percent of employees
in H–1B or L–1 status affected by the
proposed rule would pay the 9–11
Biometric Fee. The fee for H–1B and L–
1 petitions under Public Law 114–113 is
$4,000 and $4,500, respectively.
5. Identification, to the Extent
Practicable, of All Relevant Federal
Rules Which May Duplicate, Overlap, or
Conflict With the Proposed Rule
This proposed rule does not
duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any
Federal rules.
6. A Description of Any Significant
Alternatives to the Proposed Rule
Which Accomplish the Stated
Objectives of Applicable Statutes and
Which Minimize Any Significant
Economic Impact of the Proposed Rule
on Small Entities
Alternative 1 (chosen alternative):
Adopt an alternative statutory
interpretation to require covered
employers to pay the 9–11 Biometric
Fee for I–129 Form petitions, seeking
initial grants of status as well as all
extension-of-stay petitions, regardless of
whether there is a change of employer.
Alternative 2: No regulatory action.
DHS has chosen to implement
Alternative 1. DHS believes that the
alternative statutory interpretation of
Public Law 114–113 minimizes the
impact on small businesses, because
only entities with 50 or more employees
and more than 50 percent of employees
in H–1B or L–1 status must pay the 9–
11 Biometric Fee, while still allowing
DHS to receive enough funds for the
required maintenance of biometric entry
and exit data systems already in place.
While Alternative 2 would have a
smaller impact on small businesses, it
would leave DHS unable to accomplish
the stated objectives of the applicable
statutes. Therefore, DHS believes
Alternative 1 best balances funding
requirements and provides the smallest
possible impact on small businesses
while doing so.
Alternative 2 would mean that the
status quo would continue and DHS
would lack sufficient funding for the
implementation and maintenance of a
congressionally mandated biometric
entry-exit system because covered
employers would not need to pay the 9–
11 Biometric Fee for extensions. This
alternative would require DHS to
reallocate funds marked for other
purposes in order to maintain and finish
implementing current biometric entry
operations and implement biometric
exit operations, as required by section
7208 of the IRTPA.
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)) requires that
DHS consider the impact of paperwork
and other information collection
burdens imposed on the public. An
agency may not conduct, and a person
is not required to respond to, a
collection of information unless the
collection of information displays a
valid control number assigned by OMB.
Form I–129 is covered by OMB
approved collection 1615–0009. This
rule makes no changes to this
information collection, so the provisions
of the PRA do not apply to this rule.
