DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
Drug Enforcement Administration
21 CFR Part 1308
[Docket No. DEA–1362; A.G. Order No.
5931–2024]
Schedules of Controlled Substances:
Rescheduling of Marijuana
AGENCY: Drug Enforcement
Administration, Department of Justice.
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.
SUMMARY: The Department of Justice
(‘‘DOJ’’) proposes to transfer marijuana
from schedule I of the Controlled
Substances Act (‘‘CSA’’) to schedule III
of the CSA, consistent with the view of
the Department of Health and Human
Services (‘‘HHS’’) that marijuana has a
currently accepted medical use as well
as HHS’s views about marijuana’s abuse
potential and level of physical or
psychological dependence. The CSA
requires that such actions be made
through formal rulemaking on the
record after opportunity for a hearing. If
the transfer to schedule III is finalized,
the regulatory controls applicable to
schedule III controlled substances
would apply, as appropriate, along with
existing marijuana-specific
requirements and any additional
controls that might be implemented,
including those that might be
implemented to meet U.S. treaty
obligations. If marijuana is transferred
into schedule III, the manufacture,
distribution, dispensing, and possession
of marijuana would remain subject to
the applicable criminal prohibitions of
the CSA. Any drugs containing a
substance within the CSA’s definition of
‘‘marijuana’’ would also remain subject
to the applicable prohibitions in the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(‘‘FDCA’’). DOJ is soliciting comments
on this proposal.
DATES: Comments must be submitted
electronically or postmarked on or
before July 22, 2024. Interested persons
may file a request for a hearing or
waiver of an opportunity for a hearing
or to participate in a hearing pursuant
to 21 CFR 1308.44 and in accordance
with 21 CFR 1316.47 or 1316.49, as
applicable, which must be received or
postmarked on or before June 20, 2024.

of comments, please reference ‘‘Docket
No. DEA–1362’’ on all correspondence,
including any attachments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: To be
considered as part of this rulemaking,
comments and requests for a hearing
must be submitted in response to this
proposed rule within the timeframe
specified above, regardless of whether
the comment, hearing request, or other
information was previously submitted
to the Drug Enforcement Administration
(‘‘DEA’’) in connection with any prior
matter relating to the scheduling of
marijuana.
I. Posting of Public Comments
Please note that all comments
received in response to this docket are
considered part of the public record.
DOJ will make comments available for
public inspection online at https://
www.regulations.gov. Such information
includes personal or business identifiers
(such as name, address, State or Federal
identifiers, etc.) voluntarily submitted
by the commenter. Generally, all
information voluntarily submitted by
the commenter, unless clearly marked
as ‘‘Confidential Information’’ in the
method described below, will be
publicly posted. Comments may be
submitted anonymously. The Freedom
of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, applies
to all comments received.
Commenters submitting comments
that include personal identifying
information (‘‘PII’’) or confidential or
proprietary business information that
the commenter does not want made
publicly available should submit two
copies of the comment. One copy must
be marked ‘‘CONTAINS
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION’’ and
should clearly identify all PII or
business information the commenter
does not want to be made publicly
available, including any supplemental
materials. DOJ will review this copy,
including the claimed PII and
confidential business information, in its
consideration of comments. The second
copy should be marked ‘‘TO BE
PUBLICLY POSTED’’ and must have all
claimed confidential PII and business
information already redacted. DOJ will
post only the version of the comment
with redactions on https://
www.regulations.gov for public
inspection.
An electronic copy of this document
and supplemental information to this
proposed rule are available at https://
www.regulations.gov for easy reference.
DOJ specifically solicits written
comments regarding the economic
analysis of the impact of these proposed
changes. DOJ requests that commenters
provide detailed descriptions in their
comments of any expected economic
impacts, especially to small entities.
Commenters should provide empirical
data to illustrate the nature and scope of
such impact.
II. Request for Hearing, Notice of
Appearance at, or Waiver of
Participation in Hearing
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a), this
scheduling action is a formal
rulemaking ‘‘on the record after
opportunity for a hearing.’’ Such
proceedings are conducted pursuant to
the Administrative Procedure Act
(‘‘APA’’), 5 U.S.C. 551–559. See 21 CFR
1308.41 through 1308.45; id part 1316,
subpart D. Interested persons, as defined
in 21 CFR 1300.01(b), may file requests
for a hearing in conformity with the
requirements of 21 CFR 1308.44(a) and
1316.47(a), and such requests must:
(1) state with particularity the interest
of the person in the proceeding;
(2) state with particularity the
objections or issues concerning which
the person desires to be heard; and
(3) state briefly the position of the
person regarding the objections or
issues.
All requests for a hearing and waivers
of an opportunity for a hearing or
participation, together with a written
statement of position on the matters of
fact and law involved in such hearing,
must be sent to DEA using the address
information provided above.
The decision whether an in-person
hearing will be needed to address such
matters of fact and law in the
rulemaking will be made by the
Administrator of DEA. Upon the
Administrator’s determination to grant
an in-person hearing, DEA will publish
a notice of hearing on the proposed
rulemaking in the Federal Register. See
21 CFR 1308.44(b), 1316.53.
If the Administrator determines to
grant an in-person hearing to address
such matters of fact and law in this
rulemaking, the Administrator will then
designate an Administrative Law Judge
(‘‘ALJ’’) to preside over the hearing. The
ALJ’s functions shall commence upon
designation, as provided in 21 CFR
1316.52. The ALJ will have all powers
necessary to conduct a fair hearing, to
take all necessary action to avoid delay,
and to maintain order. Id. The ALJ’s
authorities include the power to hold
conferences to simplify or determine the
issues in the hearing or to consider
other matters that may aid in the
expeditious disposition of the hearing;
require parties to state their position in
writing; sign and issue subpoenas to
compel the production of documents
and materials to the extent necessary to
conduct the hearing; examine witnesses
and direct witnesses to testify; receive,
rule on, exclude, or limit evidence; rule
on procedural items; and take any
action permitted by the presiding officer
under DEA’s hearing procedures and the
APA. Id.
Comments on or objections to the
proposed rule submitted under 21 CFR
1308.43(g) will be offered as evidence at
the hearing, but the presiding officer
shall admit only evidence that is
competent, relevant, material, and not
unduly repetitive. 21 CFR 1316.59(a).

1OLC’s opinion is available in its entirety under
‘‘Supporting and Related Material’’ of the public
docket for this proposed rule at https://
www.regulations.gov under docket number DEA–
1362.
2The CSA’s reliance on formal rulemaking for
scheduling decisions indicates that HHS’s
determinations do not bind DOJ for the entirety of
the rulemaking process, because outside
participants may submit additional scientific and
medical evidence during the rulemaking that DOJ
would need to consider. OLC Op. at *25. However,
DOJ ‘‘may not simply cast aside HHS’s scientific
and medical recommendations once it initiates
rulemaking proceedings by issuing an NPRM,’’
since ‘‘[t]he categorical use of the word ‘binding’ in
section 811(b) suggests that Congress intended
HHS’s scientific and medical views to at least be a
very significant input in the scheduling process,’’
and the legislative history of the CSA bolsters that
conclusion. Id. at 25–26 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 91–
1444, at 22–23 (1970)).
Any interested person may file a
waiver of opportunity for a hearing or to
participate in a hearing in conformity
with the requirements of 21 CFR
1308.44(c), together with a written
statement of position on the matters of
fact and law involved in any hearing. 21
CFR 1316.49. Such statement, if
admissible, will be included in the
record and considered as described in
21 CFR 1308.44(c).
In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811 and
812, the purpose of a hearing would be
to ‘‘receiv[e] factual evidence and expert
opinion regarding’’ whether marijuana
should be transferred to schedule III of
the list of controlled substances. 21 CFR
1308.42. Concurrent with this
rulemaking, DEA will consider the
marijuana-specific controls that would
be necessary to comply with relevant
treaty obligations in the event that, after
the hearing, a final order reschedules
marijuana, and, to the extent such
controls are needed if marijuana is
rescheduled, will seek to finalize any
such regulations as soon as possible.
All requests for hearing and waivers
of an opportunity for a hearing or
participation must be sent to DEA using
the address information above, on or
before the date specified above.
III. Legal Authority
Under the CSA, 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.,
the Attorney General shall, before
initiating proceedings to control,
decontrol, or transfer between schedules
a drug or other substance, request from
the Secretary of HHS a scientific and
medical evaluation, and the Secretary’s
recommendations, as to whether such
drug or other substance should be so
controlled or removed as a controlled
substance. 21 U.S.C. 811(b). The
recommendations of the Secretary shall
include recommendations with respect
to the appropriate schedule, if any,
under which such drug or other
substance should be listed. Id.
HHS recommended in August 2023
that marijuana be rescheduled to
schedule III. See Letter for Anne
Milgram, Administrator, DEA, from
Rachel L. Levine, M.D., Assistant
Secretary for Health, HHS (Aug. 29,
2023) (‘‘August 2023 Letter’’). The
Attorney General then sought the legal
advice of the Office of Legal Counsel
(‘‘OLC’’) at DOJ on questions relevant to
this rulemaking proceeding. Among
other conclusions, OLC concluded that
‘‘HHS’s scientific and medical
determinations must be binding until
issuance of a notice of proposed
rulemaking [(‘NPRM’)].’’ Questions
Related to the Potential Rescheduling of
Marijuana, 45 Op. O.L.C. ll, at *25
(Apr. 11, 2024) (‘‘OLC Op.’’).1 After the
issuance of a notice of rulemaking
proceedings, HHS’s scientific and
medical determinations are accorded
‘‘significant deference’’ through the rest
of the rulemaking process.2 OLC Op. at
*26.
Under the CSA, when recommending
or determining that a drug should be
controlled (and if so, under which
schedule), the Secretary and the
Attorney General must consider eight
factors set forth in 21 U.S.C. 811(c). The
eight factors are:
1. The drug’s actual or relative
potential for abuse;
2. Scientific evidence of its
pharmacological effect, if known;
3. The state of current scientific
knowledge regarding the drug or other
substance;
4. Its history and current pattern of
abuse;
5. The scope, duration, and
significance of abuse;
6. What, if any, risk there is to the
public health;
7. Its psychic or physiological
dependence liability; and
8. Whether the substance is an
immediate precursor of a substance
already controlled.
21 U.S.C. 811(c); see also id. 811(b)
(specifying how HHS should consider
each of the eight factors).
The United States is a party to the
1961 United Nations Single Convention
on Narcotic Drugs, March 30, 1961, 18
U.S.T. 1407, 520 U.N.T.S. 151 (‘‘Single
Convention’’), as amended by the 1972
Protocol, March 25, 1972, 26 U.S.T.
1439, 976 U.N.T.S. 3. Under 21 U.S.C.
811(d)(1), if control of a substance is
required ‘‘by United States obligations
under international treaties,
conventions, or protocols in effect on
October 27, 1970,’’ the Attorney General
must issue an order controlling such
drug ‘‘under the schedule he deems
most appropriate to carry out such
obligations, without regard to the
findings’’ required by 21 U.S.C. 811(a)
or 812(b), ‘‘and without regard to the
procedures’’ prescribed by 21 U.S.C.
811(a) and (b). Marijuana is a drug
covered by the Single Convention. See
Single Convention art. 1(1)(b); OLC Op.
at *26 & n.7.
OLC and the United States Court of
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit have
explained that section 811(d)(1) does
not supersede the scheduling
procedures set forth in sections 811(a)
through (b) and 812(b), including the
requirement to consider the eight factors
set forth in section 811(c). Instead,
section 811(d)(1) allows the Attorney
General to ‘‘identify which schedules
would satisfy the United States’
international obligations with respect to
a particular drug, and then—if more
than one schedule would do so—select
which schedule to use through the
section 811(a) through (b) and 812(b)
procedures.’’ OLC Op. at *29 n.8; accord
Nat’l Org. for Reform of Marijuana Laws
(NORML II) v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735, 747
(D.C. Cir. 1977). HHS performed the
eight-factor analysis. See Memorandum
for DEA, from HHS, Re: Basis for the
Recommendation to Reschedule
Marijuana to Schedule III of the
Controlled Substances Act (‘‘HHS Basis
for Rec.’’). As noted above, HHS’s
scientific and medical determinations
are binding on DOJ until an NPRM is
published, and, in addition, DOJ must
accord ‘‘significant deference’’ to HHS’s
scientific and medical determinations
throughout the rulemaking process. OLC
Op. at *25–26.
Once the determination is made that
a particular drug or substance must be
controlled under the CSA, the Attorney
General must determine the level of
control over the drug or substance under
the CSA. See 21 U.S.C. 811(a), (b). The
CSA divides controlled substances into
five levels of control, or ‘‘schedules,’’
based on (1) a drug’s potential for abuse,
(2) whether the drug has a currently
accepted medical use in treatment in the
United States (‘‘CAMU’’), and (3)
whether there is a lack of accepted
safety for use of the drug under medical
supervision or the level of psychological
or physical dependence that could
result from abuse of the drug. See id.
812(b). Schedule I drugs have a high
potential for abuse, no CAMU, and a
lack of accepted safety for use under
medical supervision. Id. 812(b)(1).
Schedule II drugs also have a high
potential for abuse but have a CAMU (or
a CAMU with ‘‘severe restrictions’’), and
abuse of the drug may lead to severe
psychological or physical dependence.
Id. 812(b)(2). Schedule III drugs,
meanwhile, have a lower potential for

44600 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 99 / Tuesday, May 21, 2024 / Proposed Rules
3Schedule IV includes drugs that have a low
potential for abuse relative to those in schedule III,
that have a CAMU, and for which abuse may lead
to limited physical or psychological dependence
relative to those in schedule III. 21 U.S.C. 812(b)(4).
Schedule V includes drugs that have a low potential
for abuse relative to those in schedule IV, that have
a CAMU, and for which abuse may lead to limited
physical or psychological dependence relative to
those in schedule IV. Id. 812(b)(5).
4The CSA refers to the drug as ‘‘marijuana’’ and
‘‘marihuana’’ interchangeably. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C.
802(16)(A), 812(c). As used in this NPRM,
‘‘marijuana’’ means the term defined at 21 U.S.C.
802(16).

2016); Denial of Petition To Initiate Proceedings To
Reschedule Marijuana, 81 FR 53767 (Aug. 12,
2016).
6Marijuana under the CSA also does not include
‘‘the mature stalks of [the cannabis] plant, fiber
produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from
the seeds of such plant, any other compound,
manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or
preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin
extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the
sterilized seed of [the cannabis] plant which is
incapable of germination.’’ 21 U.S.C. 802(16)(B)(ii).

abuse when compared to drugs in
schedules I and II, have a CAMU, and
their abuse may lead to moderate or low
physical dependence or high
psychological dependence.3 21 U.S.C.
812(b)(3). The initial schedules of
controlled substances established by
Congress are found at 21 U.S.C. 812(c),
and the current list of all scheduled
substances is published at 21 CFR part
1308.
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1), the
Attorney General may, by rule, add to
such a schedule or transfer between
such schedules any drug or other
substance if he (A) finds that such drug
or other substance has a potential for
abuse, and (B) makes with respect to
such drug or other substance the
findings prescribed by 21 U.S.C. 812(b)
for the schedule in which such drug is
to be placed. The CSA provides that
proceedings for the issuance,
amendment, or repeal of the scheduling
of any drug or other substance may be
initiated by the Attorney General on his
own motion, at the request of the
Secretary, or on the petition of any
interested party. Id.
IV. Background
When Congress enacted the CSA in
1970, it placed marijuana in schedule I.
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention
and Control Act of 1970, Public Law 91–
513, tit. II, sec. 202(c), 84 Stat. 1236,
1249 (1970); 21 U.S.C. 812(c).4 The
Attorney General is authorized to
amend this initial placement. 21 U.S.C.
812(c); see also id. 811, 812(b). Other
schedule I substances include heroin,
lysergic acid diethylamide (commonly
known as LSD), and 3,4-methylene
dioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy). See
21 CFR 1308.11. Drugs controlled under
schedule II include cocaine,
methamphetamine, methadone,
oxycodone, and fentanyl. Id. § 1308.12.
Drugs controlled under schedule III
include products containing less than
90 milligrams of codeine per dosage
unit, ketamine, and anabolic steroids.
Id. § 1308.13. Petitioners have requested
that marijuana be rescheduled several
times over the years. See, e.g., Schedule
of Controlled Substances: Petition To
Remove Marihuana From Control or in
the Alternative To Control Marihuana in
Schedule V of the Controlled
Substances Act, 37 FR 18097 (Sept. 7,
1972); Notice of Denial of Petition, 66
FR 20038 (Apr. 18, 2001); Denial of
Petition To Initiate Proceedings To
Reschedule Marijuana, 76 FR 40552
(July 8, 2011).
DEA and HHS last examined the issue
of whether to reschedule marijuana
eight years ago, in 2016, when DEA
denied two petitions to reschedule
marijuana.5 At the time, HHS concurred
that marijuana should remain a
schedule I drug because it met the three
criteria for placement in schedule I. 81
FR 53706–07. In accordance with the
requirements for placement in schedule
I, HHS found that: (1) marijuana had a
high potential for abuse; (2) it did not
have a CAMU; and (3) there was a lack
of accepted safety for use of marijuana
under medical supervision. Id. As
discussed in detail below, in 2023, HHS
conducted a scientific and medical
evaluation of marijuana based on a
comprehensive review of available data
at that time and recommended that
marijuana be transferred to schedule III.
Since 1996, 38 States, the District of
Columbia, and 4 Federal Territories
have legalized the use of medical
marijuana. HHS Basis for Rec. at 30;
OLC Op at *9. These laws typically
allow the cultivation, sale, and use of
marijuana by patients (or their
caregivers) whose health care
practitioners have recommended that
they use marijuana to treat certain
health conditions. See, e.g., Ohio Rev.
Code secs. 3796.01(A)(6)(a)–(v),
3796.01(A); N.Y. Cannabis Law secs.
3(18), 30, 31; N.M. Stat. secs. 26–2B–
3(F)(1)–(23), 26–2B–3(N), 26–2B–4(A).
Further, beginning in Fiscal Year 2015,
Congress has adopted an appropriations
rider every year that prohibits DOJ from
using funds to prevent certain States,
Territories, and the District of Columbia
from implementing their own laws with
respect to medical marijuana. E.g.,
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024,
Public Law 118–42, sec. 531, 138 Stat.
25; Consolidated Appropriations Act,
2023, Public Law 117–328, sec. 531, 136
Stat. 4459, 4561 (2022); see also Cong.
Research Serv., R44782, The Evolution
of Marijuana as a Controlled Substance
and the Federal-State Policy Gap 26 &
n.159 (updated Apr. 7, 2022) (collecting
additional appropriations riders).
Marijuana is generally defined by
statute to mean ‘‘the plant Cannabis
sativa L., whether growing or not; the
seeds thereof; the resin extracted from
any part of such plant; and every
compound, manufacture, salt,
derivative, mixture, or preparation of
such plant, its seeds or resin.’’ 21 U.S.C.
802(16)(A). In 2018, Congress amended
the CSA to remove ‘‘(i) hemp, as defined
in section [1639o of title 7 of the U.S.
Code]’’ from the definition of
marijuana.6 Agricultural Improvement
Act of 2018, Public Law 115–334, sec.
12619, 132 Stat. 4490, 5018. Section
1639o(1) of title 7 in turn defines hemp
as ‘‘the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any
part of that plant, including the seeds
thereof and all derivatives, extracts,
cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and
salts of isomers, whether growing or not,
with a delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
concentration of not more than 0.3
percent on a dry weight basis.’’ Delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (‘‘D9-THC’’) is the
major psychoactive intoxicating
cannabinoid in marijuana. See HHS
Basis for Rec. at 10. This exclusion of
hemp from the definition of marijuana
had the effect of removing many
products containing predominantly
cannabidiol (‘‘CBD’’) derived from hemp
and containing no more than 0.3 percent
D9-THC on a dry weight basis from
control as marijuana.
On October 6, 2022, President Biden
requested that the Attorney General and
the Secretary of HHS ‘‘initiate the
administrative process to review
expeditiously how marijuana is
scheduled under federal law.’’ 7 HHS
thereafter undertook a scientific and
medical evaluation of marijuana as
defined under the CSA in accordance
with the President’s request.
In a letter dated August 29, 2023,
Admiral Rachel L. Levine, M.D., HHS’s
Assistant Secretary for Health,
recommended to the Administrator of
DEA that marijuana be controlled in
schedule III of the CSA. August 2023
Letter. HHS found that marijuana has a
potential for abuse less than the drugs
or other substances in schedules I and
II; that marijuana has a CAMU; and that
the abuse of marijuana may lead to
moderate or low physical dependence
or high psychological dependence. HHS

correspond to the criteria for placement
of a substance in schedule III. See 21
U.S.C. 812(b)(3). DEA has not yet made
a determination as to its views of the
appropriate schedule for marijuana.
V. Proposal To Reschedule Marijuana
The CSA vests the Attorney General
with the authority to schedule,
reschedule, or decontrol drugs. 21
U.S.C. 811(a). The Attorney General has
delegated that authority to the DEA
Administrator, see 28 CFR 0.100, but
also retains the authority to schedule
drugs under the CSA in the first
instance, see 28 U.S.C. 509, 510. The
HHS Assistant Secretary for Health has
provided a recommendation for
transferring marijuana to schedule III. In
light of that recommendation, the
Attorney General is exercising the
Attorney General’s authority under 21
U.S.C. 811(a) to initiate a rulemaking
that proposes the placement of
marijuana in schedule III.
DEA believes that additional
information arising from this
rulemaking will further inform the
findings regarding the appropriate
schedule for marijuana. DEA has
maintained an active review of the
scientific literature addressing
marijuana with a focus on how it relates
to the scientific and medical evaluation
and informs any updates to the eightfactor analysis. In addition to HHS’s
scientific and medical determinations,
which are binding until the issuance of
this NPRM and which must be accorded
significant deference throughout the
rulemaking, DEA believes that factual
evidence (including scientific data) and
expert opinions, including additional
data regarding different forms,
formulations, and delivery methods for
marijuana, as well as evidence regarding
the effects of marijuana at various
dosages or concentrations, may be
relevant.

DEA’s analyses explaining its decisions
to deny the petitions to reschedule
marijuana in 2016, and the 2024 OLC
opinion (cited throughout) are available
in their entirety under ‘‘Supporting and
Related Material’’ of the public docket
for this proposed rule at https://
www.regulations.gov under docket
number DEA–1362.
VI. Eight-Factor Analysis
DOJ has reviewed the scientific and
medical evaluation and scheduling
recommendation provided by HHS and
has conducted a separate review of the
eight factors identified in 21 U.S.C.
811(c). At this point in the proceedings,
DOJ must treat HHS’s scientific and
medical determinations as binding. See
OLC Op. at *4, *25. HHS’s scientific and
medical determinations are included
below, as well as certain information
from DEA.
1. Marijuana’s Actual or Relative
Potential for Abuse
The first factor that DOJ and HHS
must consider under 21 U.S.C. 811(c) is
the actual or relative potential for abuse
of marijuana. The term ‘‘abuse’’ is not
defined in the CSA. However, consistent
with the legislative history of the CSA,
DEA and HHS have typically weighed
the following factors in determining
whether a particular drug or substance
has a potential for abuse: 8
A. Whether there is evidence that
individuals are taking the drug or drugs
containing such a substance in amounts
sufficient to create a hazard to their
health or to the safety of other
individuals or to the community.
As part of its analysis, HHS
concluded that evidence shows that,
although some individuals are taking
marijuana in amounts sufficient to
create a hazard to their health and to the
safety of other individuals and the
community, the vast majority of
individuals who use marijuana are
doing so in a manner that does not lead
to dangerous outcomes to themselves or
others. HHS Basis for Rec. at 6–7. The
data supportive of this conclusion are
discussed in detail in HHS’s analysis of
Factors 4, 5, and 6. See HHS Basis for
Rec. at 28–57.
In particular, HHS emphasized that an
evaluation of various epidemiological
databases of adverse outcomes from
2015 to 2021 involving marijuana or
comparator drugs that are used
nonmedically showed that the
utilization-adjusted rate of adverse
outcomes involving marijuana was
consistently lower than the utilizationadjusted rates of adverse outcomes
involving heroin, cocaine, and, for
certain outcomes, other comparators,
including alcohol. Also, alcohol or
heroin typically ranked first or in
immediately subsequent positions
among the comparators in terms of
incidence of adverse outcomes, with
marijuana in a lower place in that
ranking. This pattern also was observed
for serious medical outcomes, including
death, observed in Poison Center data,
where marijuana was in the lowest
ranking group. This suggests
consistency across databases, across
drugs, and over time. HHS thus
concluded that although abuse of
marijuana produces clear evidence of
harmful consequences, these appear to
be relatively less common and less
severe than the consequences of some
other comparator substances. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 7–8.
Importantly, these comparisons of the
prevalence of adverse outcomes were
from descriptive analyses only,
following the established practice in
previous eight-factor analyses. Thus,
differences in outcome frequency and
severity, and the ranked order across
comparators, may be attributable in part
to underlying differences in the
populations being compared (e.g., age or
pre-existing medical conditions), among
other things. Despite these limitations,
qualitative synthesis of descriptive
analyses is the established practice in
previous eight-factor analyses, and HHS
determined that it is the most
appropriate approach here. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 7–8.
HHS also concluded that the publichealth risks posed by marijuana are
lower compared to those posed by other
drugs of abuse (e.g., heroin, oxycodone,
cocaine), based on HHS’s evaluation of
various epidemiological databases for
emergency department (‘‘ED’’) visits,
hospitalizations, unintentional
exposures, and most importantly,
overdose deaths. The rank order of the
comparators in terms of greatest adverse
consequences typically ranked heroin,
benzodiazepines, and cocaine first or in
immediately subsequent positions, with
marijuana in a lower place in the
ranking, especially when HHS adjusted
for utilization. For overdose deaths,
marijuana is always in the lowest
ranking among comparator drugs. These
evaluations demonstrate that there is
consistency across databases, across
substances, and over time. HHS thus
concluded that although abuse of
marijuana produces clear evidence of a
risk to public health, that risk is
relatively lower than that posed by most
other comparator drugs. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 7–8.
DEA notes that data provided by HHS
in its recommendation included a 2023
national survey that tracks drug use
trends among 8th-, 10th-, and 12thgrade students, and showed that by 12th
grade, 20.2 percent of students reported
using marijuana in the past month.9
DEA also notes that the same study
showed that the prevalence of ingesting
marijuana by vaping is evidenced by

individuals reporting current use of marijuana and
the lack of an FDA-approved drug product in the
United States, one can assume that it is likely that
the majority of individuals using marijuana do so
on their own initiative rather than on the basis of
medical advice from a licensed practitioner.’’).
students reporting vaping in the 30 days
prior at the following rates: 4.2 percent
for 8th graders, 10.3 percent for 10th
graders, and 14.8 percent for 12th
graders.10 In 2022, the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services
Administration’s (‘‘SAMHSA’’) Drug
Abuse Warning Network (‘‘DAWN’’)
reported that 11.9 percent of drugrelated ED visits nationwide involved
cannabis.11 The rate of cannabis-related
ED visits was highest in these
demographic groups: 18 to 25 years old,
male, Black or African American, and
Not Hispanic or Latino.12
In addition to the data considered by
the HHS Basis for Recommendation, the
data considered by HHS and DEA in
their 2015 eight-factor analysis, and the
additional data discussed above, DEA
anticipates that additional data on
seizures of marijuana by law
enforcement, cannabis-related ED visits,
as well as updated epidemiological
survey data since 2022, may be
appropriate for consideration.
B. Whether there is significant
diversion of the drug or drugs
containing such a substance from
legitimate drug channels.
HHS found that there is a lack of
evidence of significant diversion of
marijuana from legitimate drug
channels. HHS Basis for Rec. at 8. It
noted that marijuana is used by
researchers for clinical research under
investigational new drug (‘‘IND’’)
applications, and that there are multiple
DEA registrants that are approved to
produce marijuana and derived
formulations for use in DEA-authorized
nonclinical and clinical research. HHS
observed that these authorizations
represent the only federally sanctioned
drug channels in the United States, and
there is a lack of data indicating
diversion occurring from these entities
or activities. However, there are
significant additional sources of
marijuana in the United States,
including from illicit cultivation and
production, illicit importation from
other countries, and from State
programs that permit dispensing of
marijuana for medical use and, in some
States, recreational adult use. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 8.
Given this unique landscape, DEA
believes that the lack of data indicating
diversion of marijuana from federally
sanctioned drug channels to the illicit
market is not indicative of a lack of
potential for abuse of the drug. DEA
anticipates that additional data on
diversion from State programs and DEAregistered manufacturers may aid in a
determination of whether diversion is
taking place.
C. Whether individuals are taking the
drug or drugs containing such a
substance on their own initiative rather
than on the basis of medical advice from
a practitioner licensed by law to
administer such drugs in the course of
their professional practice.
As HHS notes, the Food and Drug
Administration (‘‘FDA’’) has not
approved a New Drug Application
(‘‘NDA’’) for a drug product containing
botanical marijuana for any therapeutic
indication. Thus, the only way an
individual can use marijuana on the
basis of medical advice through
legitimate channels under Federal law is
by participating in research under an
IND. However, 38 States and the District
of Columbia have enacted laws allowing
individuals to use marijuana under
certain circumstances for medical
purposes. Outside of the Federal- and
State-sanctioned medical use of
marijuana, individuals are using
marijuana on their own initiative for
medical, as well as nonmedical,
purposes. Epidemiological data related
to nonmedical use of marijuana is
detailed in HHS’s analysis of Factor 4.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 8.
DEA notes that data is not available to
determine the number of individuals
using marijuana under State law.
According to 2022 National Survey on
Drug Use and Health (‘‘NSDUH’’) data
on people who are 12 and older in the
United States, 61.9 million people
reported using marijuana in the past
year, and marijuana was the illicit drug
used with the greatest frequency.13
Specifically, 42.3 million people
reported use in the past month,
including 14.7 million people who
vaped marijuana in that same period,
representing 5.2 percent of the study’s
target population.14 Furthermore, as
reported by NSDUH in 2022, 3.7 million
people initiated marijuana use in the
past year, with more than half (53
percent or 2.0 million people) initiating
marijuana use before the age of 21.15
DEA also notes that HHS concluded
that, outside of the Federal- and Statesanctioned medical use of marijuana,
individuals are using marijuana on their
own initiative for medical as well as
nonmedical purposes. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 8. In 2016, DEA reached a
similar conclusion.16 In addition to the
data considered in the HHS Basis for
Recommendation, and by HHS and DEA
in their earlier eight-factor analyses,
DEA anticipates that updated
epidemiological survey data since 2022
may be appropriate for consideration.
D. Whether the drug or drugs
containing such a substance are new
drugs so related in their action to a drug
or drugs already listed as having a
potential for abuse to make it likely that
it will have the same potentiality for
abuse as such drugs, thus making it
reasonable to assume that there may be
significant diversions from legitimate
channels, significant use contrary to or
without medical advice, or that they
have a substantial capability of creating
hazards to the health of the user or to
the safety of the community.
Marijuana has been a schedule I
substance since the CSA was enacted in
1970. See Public Law 91–513, tit. II, sec.
202(c), 84 Stat. 1236, 1249 (1970); 21
U.S.C. 812(c); see also 21 CFR
1308.11(d)(23). The primary compound
in marijuana that is responsible for its
abuse potential is D9-THC (also known
as dronabinol, when specifically
referring to the (-)-trans-D9-THC
stereoisomer), which has agonist
activity at cannabinoid CB1 receptors.
HHS found that there are extensive
nonclinical and clinical studies
establishing that marijuana, due to the
CB1 agonist activity of its main
cannabinoid constituent D9-THC,
produces rewarding effects that would
be consistent with observed long-term
patterns of nonmedical use and abuse,
both before and in the years since
enactment of the CSA. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 9. For further discussion of these
effects, see HHS Basis for Rec. at 9–18
(Factor 2), 28–37 (Factor 4).
Additionally, FDA has approved two
drug products containing dronabinol:
Marinol (in 1985; schedule III) and
Syndros (in 2016; schedule II). HHS
Basis for Rec. at 9. Marinol was
approved by FDA in 1985 for the
treatment of nausea and vomiting
associated with cancer chemotherapy in
patients who did not respond to
conventional anti-emetic treatments.
FDA approved Marinol in 1992 for the
treatment of anorexia associated with
weight loss in patients with acquired

Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 99 / Tuesday, May 21, 2024 / Proposed Rules 44603
immunodeficiency syndrome (‘‘AIDS’’).
After the first FDA approval, Marinol
was transferred from schedule I to
schedule II and was later rescheduled to
schedule III. Syndros, a drug product
also containing dronabinol but
formulated in an oral solution, was
approved by FDA in 2016 for the
treatment of anorexia associated with
weight loss in patients with AIDS, as
well as nausea and vomiting associated
with cancer chemotherapy in patients
who failed to respond adequately to
conventional anti-emetic treatments. In
2017, DEA rescheduled ‘‘FDA-approved
products containing dronabinol in an
oral solution’’ from schedule I into
schedule II. HHS Basis for Rec. at 4.
When Marinol and Syndros were
being developed, they underwent a
systematic evaluation of their abuse
potential based on animal and human
behavioral studies, which showed that
dronabinol has abuse potential. The
abuse-related studies confirmed the
abuse potential of D9-THC. HHS has
concluded that these findings suggest
that marijuana will continue to be used
nonmedically, diverted from legitimate
channels, and trafficked in illicit
channels as a potential source for
continued nonmedical use in the United
States. HHS Basis for Rec. at 9; see also
HHS Basis for Rec. at 37–45 (Factor 5).
HHS Conclusion With Respect to
Factor 1
HHS determined that epidemiological
data indicate that marijuana has the
potential for creating hazards to the
health of the user and to the safety of
the community. However, as a relative
finding on abuse liability, when
comparing marijuana to heroin,
oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl,
cocaine, ketamine, benzodiazepines,
zolpidem, tramadol, and alcohol in
various epidemiological databases that
allow for some or all of these
comparisons, marijuana is not typically
among the substances producing the
most frequent incidence of adverse
outcomes or severity of substance use
disorder. HHS Basis for Rec. at 9; see
also HHS Basis for Rec. at 28–57
(Factors 4, 5, and 6). But as noted above,
there are limitations in comparing
descriptive data on adverse outcomes
across drugs, although descriptive
analyses of epidemiologic data are an
established practice in previous eightfactor analyses. HHS Basis for Rec. at 9.
In 2016, DEA found that ‘‘[m]arijuana
has a high potential for abuse.
Preclinical and clinical data show that
it has reinforcing effects characteristic of
drugs of abuse. . . . Data on marijuana
seizures show widespread availability
and trafficking.’’ 81 FR 53739. DEA
believes that additional data in this area
may be appropriate for consideration in
assessing marijuana’s actual or relative
potential for abuse.
2. Scientific Evidence of Marijuana’s
Pharmacological Effects, If Known
The second factor that DOJ and HHS
must consider under 21 U.S.C. 811(c) is
the scientific evidence of marijuana’s
pharmacological effects, if known. In
making its recommendation, HHS
considered the scientific evidence of the
pharmacological effects of marijuana
based on the effects of D9-THC. HHS
conducted a scientific evaluation of the
neurochemistry, receptor pharmacology,
animal abuse-related behavioral effects,
and human behavioral and
physiological effects of marijuana. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 9.
A. Neurochemistry and Receptor
Pharmacology of Marijuana
Cannabis is the genus of a plant that
contains numerous natural constituents,
including cannabinoids. See HHS Basis
for Rec. at 18–21 (discussing Factor 3).
Because cultivated chemovars may vary
in their composition and concentration
of various chemical constituents,
including with respect to whether they
contain significant amounts of D9-THC
or other cannabinoids, marijuana
products from different strains will have
differing biological and pharmacological
profiles. HHS Basis for Rec. at 10.
Marijuana contains at least 560
identified natural constituents,
including 125 compounds classified as
cannabinoids. Most major cannabinoid
compounds occurring naturally in
cannabis have been identified
chemically, but new and minor
compounds are continuously being
characterized. HHS Basis for Rec. at 10.
The two most abundant cannabinoids
present in marijuana are D9-THC and
CBD. D9-THC is the major psychoactive
intoxicating cannabinoid in marijuana
and is the component of marijuana that
is primarily responsible for its abuse
potential. In contrast, CBD has
negligible abuse potential, as assessed
by FDA during the NDA review for
Epidiolex, an FDA-approved drug
product containing plant derived,
highly purified CBD. HHS Basis for Rec.
at 10.
There are two cannabinoid receptors:
CB1 and CB2. CB1 and CB2 receptors
belong to the family of G-proteincoupled receptors and present a typical
seven transmembrane-spanning domain
structure. Cannabinoid receptors
primarily link to an inhibitory G protein
(Gi/o), such that adenylate cyclase
activity is inhibited when a cannabinoid
ligand binds to the receptor. This, in
turn, prevents the conversion of
adenosine triphosphate to the second
messenger, cyclic AMP (‘‘cAMP’’),
which decreases cAMP levels. As HHS’s
analysis described, G proteins also
contain beta/gamma G protein units that
are also liberated following ligand
binding, which then bind to and alter
ion channel function, including
inhibition of voltage-gated ion channels
and activation of potassium channels.
Ligand binding can also activate some
subforms of phospholipase C as well as
beta-arrestin protein. All of these second
messenger routes amplify the neural
signal following cannabinoid binding at
the CB1 and CB2 receptors. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 10.
CB1 receptors are found primarily in
the central nervous system (‘‘CNS’’), but
are also present in peripheral tissues,
such as the liver, heart, and lungs. In the
brain, CB1 receptors are expressed with
highest density in the cortical regions,
hippocampus, basal ganglia, and
cerebellum and with lowest density in
brainstem and hypothalamic areas. The
localization of these receptors may
explain cannabinoid effects on
movement coordination, memory, and
cognition. Additionally, CB1 receptors
are found in glial cells as well as in the
immune system. However, the
concentration of CB1 receptors is
considerably lower in peripheral tissues
than in the CNS. CB2 receptors are
found primarily in the immune system,
including in numerous leukocyte cell
types, as well as in activated CNS
microglia. Additionally, there is some
evidence that CB2 receptors are
localized in the brain, primarily in the
cerebellum and hippocampus. The
distribution of CB2 receptors throughout
the body is less extensive than the
distribution of CB1 receptors. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 10–11.
There are two endogenous
cannabinoid receptor agonists:
anandamide and arachidonyl glycerol
(‘‘2–AG’’). At CB1 receptors,
anandamide is a partial agonist with
low intrinsic efficacy while 2–AG is a
full agonist with high intrinsic efficacy.
These endogenous cannabinoid ligands
are present in central as well as
peripheral tissues. A combination of
uptake and hydrolysis terminates the
action of anandamide and 2–AG. The
endogenous cannabinoid system is a
locally active signaling system activated
on demand in response to changes to
the local conditions to help restore
homeostasis. The endogenous
cannabinoid system, including the
endogenous cannabinoids and the
cannabinoid receptors, demonstrates
substantial plasticity in response to
several physiological and pathological
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:01 May 20, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\21MYP1.SGM 21MYP1

44604 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 99 / Tuesday, May 21, 2024 / Proposed Rules
stimuli. This plasticity is particularly
evident in the CNS. HHS Basis for Rec.
at 11.
D9-THC and CBD have varying
affinity and effects at the cannabinoid
receptors. HHS determined that D9-THC
is a partial agonist at both CB1 (Ki = 18–
218 nM) and CB2 receptors (Ki = 36–309
nM). However, CB1 receptors are the
main pharmacological site of action for
D9-THC, making CB1 receptors the site
that is responsible for the abuse
potential of marijuana. The other CNS
site where D9-THC may have activity is
the 5HT3 receptor, where it functions as
an antagonist. In contrast, CBD has low
affinity for both CB1 and CB2 receptors
and may act as a negative allosteric
modulator or weak antagonist at these
sites. CBD has additional CNS effects as
a serotonin 5HT1A agonist and a
serotonin 5HT2A weak partial agonist, as
well as a serotonin 5HT3A antagonist.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 11.
In the past 30 years, the potency of
marijuana with regard to D9-THC has
increased dramatically. HHS described
one study finding that the concentration
of D9-THC in marijuana samples in the
United States increased from 3 percent
in 1991 to 17.1 percent in 2017. These
increases are likely due to an increase
in the number of high potency samples
(i.e., sinsemilla) in the overall samples
tested. Based on an evaluation of
marijuana seized by DEA, the majority
of samples contained high
concentrations of D9-THC and low
concentrations of CBD. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 11–12.
B. Animal Abuse-Related Behavioral
Effects
Self-Administration
Self-administration is a method that
assesses the ability of a drug to produce
rewarding effects. The presence of
rewarding effects increases the
likelihood that individuals will try to
obtain additional quantities of a drug.
Animal self-administration of a drug is
often useful in suggesting whether
humans will experience a particular
substance as having rewarding effects,
which is indicative of abuse potential.
For example, the tendency of rhesus
monkeys to self-administer a drug is
correlated with humans’ propensity to
abuse it. HHS Basis for Rec. at 12.
Since self-administration is a
methodology in which the test drug is
typically administered intravenously to
rats, it is not possible to evaluate
botanical marijuana through selfadministration. However, given that D9-
THC is the primary substance that
confers abuse potential to marijuana, its
ability to induce self-administration can
serve as an indicator of the abuse
potential of marijuana. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 12.
HHS concluded, after weighing the
relevant scientific evidence, that D9-
THC produces rewarding effects that
lead an animal to repeatedly seek out
the substance. HHS Basis for Rec. at 12.
Specifically, some studies have
demonstrated successful animal selfadministration of D9-THC following
intravenous administration,
administration of inhaled vapor, oral
administration, and
intracerebroventricular administration.
Other recent animal studies have not
been able to produce D9-THC selfadministration following intravenous
administration and oral administration,
but HHS concluded that these results
were due to the specific methodology of
those respective studies, rather than
valid evidence of the rewarding effects
of D9-THC, and thus do not negate
HHS’s reliance on studies in which D9-
THC was actively self-administered by
animals. HHS Basis for Rec. at 12–13.
Furthermore, a comprehensive
deconstruction of which animal
methodology is optimal for producing
preclinical self-administration of D9-
THC is not necessary for an evaluation
of the abuse potential of marijuana in
humans because it is already clear that
humans utilize marijuana for its
rewarding properties. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 13. Animal self-administration is
used primarily to predict whether a
novel substance is likely to be used by
humans for its rewarding properties as
an indication of its abuse potential.
However, epidemiological data already
amply demonstrates that humans selfadminister substances that contain D9-
THC, including botanical marijuana, for
their ability to produce positive
subjective responses, including
euphoria. HHS Basis for Rec. at 13; see
also sections VI.4–6 of this preamble
(discussing Factors 4–6).
Conditioned Place Preference
A conditioned place preference
(‘‘CPP’’) study is another method for
determining whether drugs have
rewarding properties; a CPP study relies
on an animal’s decision to spend time
in a location associated with receiving
a drug. The studies in which D9-THC
successfully produced CPP occurred
under very specific experimental
conditions, similar to the D9-THC selfadministration studies in animals.
Experimental manipulations in CPP
studies with D9-THC have included
varying the animal species, sex, dose, or
route of administration; introducing
flavors to obscure unpleasant taste; and
varying the drug history of the animals
tested. However, as with animal selfadministration, the purpose of CPP
studies is typically to determine if a
new drug produces rewarding
sensations, which would suggest that a
drug has abuse potential in humans.
Since it is clear that humans selfadminister substances that contain D9-
THC, including botanical marijuana,
HHS determined that it was not
necessary to determine which CPP
methods are optimal for demonstrating
that D9-THC has rewarding properties in
animals. HHS Basis for Rec. at 13.
Drug Discrimination Studies
Drug discrimination is a method in
which animals indicate whether a test
drug produces sensations similar to
those produced by a training drug with
a known pharmacological mechanism of
action. Drug discrimination is
considered to be an abuse-related study
only when the training drug is a known
drug of abuse that is scheduled under
the CSA and the test drug may have
abusable effects similar to the training
drug based on having a similar
mechanism of action to the training
drug. Because animal drug
discrimination studies often use D9-THC
as the standard for establishing if new
drugs have classic marijuana-like
pharmacological activity, HHS did not
examine whether this method should be
applied when evaluating the abuse
potential of D9-THC. HHS Basis for Rec.
at 14.
C. Human Behavioral and Physiological
Effects
Subjective Effects of D9-THC
The psychological, behavioral, and
subjective responses to marijuana in
humans have been known and
characterized since antiquity. In the
modern period, data on the
psychological, behavioral, and
subjective responses to marijuana are
available from the drug labels of FDAapproved drug products, from
prospective human abuse potential
(‘‘HAP’’) studies, from accounts
published in the scientific and medical
literature, and from an evaluation
published in 2017 by the National
Academies of Science, Engineering, and
Medicine (‘‘NASEM’’). HHS Basis for
Rec. at 14.

HAP Studies
HAP studies evaluate whether a test
drug produces positive subjective
responses compared to a placebo and a
known drug of abuse that is scheduled
under the CSA and serves as the
positive control. If the test drug
produces rewarding effects that are
statistically significantly greater than
the placebo, and beyond the acceptable
placebo range of response, it is an
indication that the drug may have abuse
potential. The relative abuse potential is
suggested by the responses from the
positive control on these measures in
comparison to the test drug. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 15.
After analyzing a number of HAP
studies of marijuana and D9-THC, which
varied in the in dose of D9-THC, the
route of administration, or whether the
D9-THC was provided in the form of
marijuana or isolated compound, HHS
identified a number of commonalities.
First, following administration of the
study drug (i.e., marijuana or D9-THC),
there were increases in positive
subjective responses. Second, the
studies demonstrated increases on the
Addiction Research Center Inventory
scales for the morphine benzedrine
group (euphoria), marijuana, and
amphetamine. HHS concluded that
these data consistently demonstrated
that D9-THC, in the form of marijuana
or as an isolated compound, produces
rewarding effects that are indicative of
abuse potential when it is administered
under controlled experimental
conditions. Third, and in contrast to the
prior findings, the data also
demonstrated that the administration of
marijuana or D9-THC may result in
negative subjective responses reflecting
negative drug effects and sedation; these
are often delayed in onset from when
the positive subjective effects begin.
HHS noted that the positive and
negative subjective responses following
administration of marijuana or D9-THC
were often dose-dependent. It also noted
that there were typically few differences
between responses to marijuana and D9-
THC, or between responses based on
route of administration of the study
drug. HHS Basis for Rec. at 15.
Common Responses to Marijuana in
Humans Published in Scientific and
Medical Literature
HHS concluded that the responses to
dronabinol reported during
development of Marinol and the
responses to marijuana and D9-THC
reported in HAP studies paralleled the
common responses to marijuana that
have been described by other medical
scientists. These responses include
positive subjective responses (such as
euphoria or happiness), sedative
responses (such as drowsiness or
changes in sleep), anxiety and negative
responses (such as panic attacks,
agitation, and paranoia), perceptual
changes (such as hallucinations and
changes in perception), psychiatric,
social, and cognitive changes (such as
drug abuse, delusions, memory and
concentration impairment, and
impaired judgment), and physiological
responses (such as nausea, tachycardia,
facial flushing, dry mouth, tremor,
dizziness, ataxia, and hyperemesis). The
literature reviewed by HHS also
concluded that the positive changes that
occur following use of marijuana are
pleasurable to many humans and are
associated with drug-seeking and drugtaking; and that these effects are
typically dose-dependent, with higher
doses and routes of administration that
produce faster onset producing more
intense responses and the likelihood of
more negative subjective effects. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 16–17.
National Academies of Science,
Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM)
HHS also reviewed a book-length
evaluation of marijuana by NASEM
entitled The Health Effects of Cannabis
and Cannabinoids: The Current State of
Evidence and Recommendations for
Research.17 According to HHS, in this
evaluation, NASEM provided a brief
summary of the clinical features of
marijuana intoxication and found that
(1) during acute cannabis intoxication,
the user’s sociability and sensitivity to
certain stimuli (e.g., colors, music) may
be enhanced, the perception of time is
altered, and the appetite for sweet and
fatty foods is heightened; (2) some users
report feeling relaxed or experiencing a
pleasurable rush or buzz after smoking
cannabis; (3) these subjective effects
were often associated with decreased
short-term memory, dry mouth, and
impaired perception and motor skills;
and (4) when very high blood levels of
D9-THC were attained, persons might
experience panic attacks, paranoid
thoughts, and hallucinations. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 17–18.
HHS Conclusion With Respect to
Factor 2
Based on its analysis of the studies
discussed above, HHS concluded that
D9-THC, the substance largely
responsible for the abuse potential of
marijuana, is a partial agonist at the
cannabinoid CB1 receptor. When D9-
THC is administered to animals, it
produces rewarding responses, as
evidenced by its ability to induce selfadministration and CPP. This is
consistent with the data from human
studies and from clinical observations,
where administration of D9-THC or use
of marijuana produces euphoria and
other pleasurable responses, as well as
sedation and anxiety responses.
Psychiatric, social, and cognitive
responses, which are often experienced
as negative, are also reported, as are
physiological responses such as dry
mouth, ataxia, and increased hunger. As
described in HHS’s analysis of Factor 4,
see HHS Basis for Rec. at 32–37, the
rewarding responses observed in
humans are consistent with the
prevalence of nonmedical use of
marijuana, which includes abuse of the
substance. Abuse of marijuana by
individuals can lead to other negative
consequences, including addiction and
the need to seek medical attention
through calls to poison centers or visits
to an ED, as described in Factor 5, see
HHS Basis for Rec. at 38–39, 42. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 18.
DEA believes that additional data on
marijuana’s pharmacological effects may
be appropriate for consideration in
assessing this factor.
3. The State of Current Scientific
Knowledge Regarding Marijuana
The third factor that DOJ and HHS
must consider under 21 U.S.C. 811(c) is
the state of current scientific knowledge
regarding marijuana. In considering this
factor and making its recommendation,
HHS examined the chemistry of
marijuana and the human
pharmacokinetics of marijuana. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 18–24.
Chemistry
Cannabis is a genus of annual
flowering plant with digitate leaves in
the family Cannabaceae Martinov that
likely originated in Central or Southeast
Asia over 10,000 years ago and was first
cultivated in China for fiber and seed
production. Cultivation eventually

spread across Asia, Africa, and Europe
and then to the Americas. A
longstanding and significant historical
debate by botanists and taxonomists
continues today regarding the number of
species in the Cannabis genus, but it is
generally treated as a single, highly
polymorphic species known as
Cannabis sativa L., with the other two
previously reported species listed as
Cannabis indica Lam. and Cannabis
ruderalis Janisch. Plants previously
believed to be part of the latter two
species are generally recognized as
varieties (or subspecies) of Cannabis
sativa L., which are commonly referred
to as sativa var. indica and sativa var.
ruderalis. Cannabis sativa and sativa
var. indica plants are widely cultivated
for their size, branching, and
cannabinoid content, while sativa var.
ruderalis is rarely cultivated alone
because it is shorter, is often
unbranched, and has very low
cannabinoid content. Worldwide
Cannabis varieties are separated into
hundreds of different cultivars and
strains. Plants selected for cultivation
are known as cultivated varieties or
cultivars, whereas plants reproduced
asexually from a cultivar through clonal
propagation are known as strains. These
practices have resulted in significantly
different chemical profiles for Cannabis
cultivars, and the classification term to
account for these chemical profile
differences has evolved. The term
‘‘chemovar’’ accounts for the plant’s
chemical profile and is a more
meaningful classification for clinical
researchers studying the plant’s
potential drug effects. Marijuana
products developed from diverse
chemovars will have different safety,
biological, pharmacological, and
toxicological profiles. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 18–19.
Cannabis is a dioecious plant,
meaning female and male flowers occur
on separate plants, and rarely occurs as
a monoecious plant (i.e., single plant
containing male and female flowers).
The glandular trichomes found on the
female plant’s unfertilized flower heads
and bracts contain the highest
concentrations of cannabinoids. For this
reason, unfertilized female chemovars
are favored to harvest large
inflorescences (i.e., complete flower
head) for their rich cannabinoid and
terpene content. HHS Basis for Rec. at
19.
The Cannabis sativa L. plant naturally
contains many different compounds,
and more than 550 have been identified,
such as cannabinoids, terpenoids,
flavonoids, stilbenoids, steroids,
polysaccharides, benzoquinone,
phenanthrenes, spiroindans, lignans,
fatty acids, sugars, hydrocarbons, amino
acids, and proteins. Cannabinoids are
mainly found in living Cannabis sativa
L. plants in their non-psychoactive
carboxylated forms (i.e., acid form),
which require drying, heating,
combustion, or aging to decarboxylate to
their neutral forms, and are primarily
composed of C21 terpenophenolic
compounds. The most abundant neutral
form cannabinoids are D9-THC and
CBD, but nearly 200 have been
identified in the plant and are divided
into subclasses: cannabigerols,
cannabichromenes, CBDs, D9-THCs, (-)-
D8-trans-tetrahydrocannabinols (‘‘D8-
THCs’’), cannabicyclols, cannabielsoins,
cannabinols, cannabinodiols,
cannabitriols, and the miscellaneous
cannabinoids. HHS Basis for Rec. at 19.
Like any other botanical substance,
marijuana plants are heterogeneous in
nature and contain a complex chemical
profile. Moreover, variable organic plant
material, as well as manufactured
preparations, result in a variety of
product forms that dictate different
routes of administration, associated
risks, and differences in quality of the
product used, which may also influence
risk for users. Among other things, these
differences can result from differences
in harvest location, growing conditions,
the season in which the marijuana is
harvested, and the manner in which the
marijuana is processed, handled,
transported, and tested. The potential
for high variability of marijuana and
marijuana-derived products, both in
product composition and impurity
profile, is a major consideration for the
potential variability of drug effects and
safety. HHS Basis for Rec. at 19–20.
Processing of marijuana and its use in
further manufacturing can lead to a
range of forms that individuals may use
or consume, including crude mixtures
and highly purified substances of
botanical origin, many of which may be
cannabinoid compounds. Among
known cannabinoids in the Cannabis
plant, both D9-THC and D8-THC
produce marijuana’s psychoactive
effects. Because D9-THC is significantly
more abundant than D8-THC,
marijuana’s intoxicating effects are
largely attributed to the former. Only
small quantities of D8-THC acid and D8-
THC have been identified in plants.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 20.
As noted above, the 2018
amendments to the CSA removed hemp
from the definition of marijuana.
However, the term ‘‘cannabis’’ is still
often broadly used to refer to a wide
variety of products manufactured from
the Cannabis sativa L. plant, regardless
of their control status. As a result of the
2018 amendments to the CSA, a large
hemp marketplace exists, containing a
wide variety of products. In addition,
the public has access to cannabis
products within the CSA definition of
marijuana through State-authorized
adult-use (i.e., nonmedical use) and
medical-use programs, as well as via the
illicit marketplace. See HHS Basis for
Rec. at 28–37 (Factor 4). Because of
these diverse sources of marijuana, there
is a lack of unified controls on
cultivation and manufacturing, which
raises concerns related to the safety,
quality, and consistency of botanical
substances (e.g., botanical raw materials,
extracts, and intermediates) and final
product formulations that are currently
accessed for medical and nonmedical
use. Products sourced from Stateauthorized adult-use and medical-use
programs are subject to a patchwork of
inconsistent product standards and
safety requirements. Although some
State programs have a set of standards
(for example, on manufacturing, testing,
labeling, and packaging), each program’s
controls are different, leading to a wide
variation of products across Stateauthorized programs. And the illicit
marketplace is not subject to any
standards or oversight. As a result, the
range of products within the CSA’s
definition of marijuana encompasses a
large degree of variation in forms for
consumption, composition of
biologically relevant constituents,
potency, and contaminants. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 21.
In short, marijuana has hundreds of
chemovars containing variable
concentrations of D9-THC,
cannabinoids, and other compounds. As
a result, in evaluating whether to
recommend that marijuana be
rescheduled, HHS focused to the
greatest extent possible on wide-ranging
substances derived from cannabis plants
that are vehicles for the selfadministration of D9-THC as the key
biologically active substance on which
the CSA’s current definition of
marijuana is based. HHS Basis for Rec.
at 21.
Human Pharmacokinetics of D9-THC
HHS reported that the
pharmacokinetics of D9-THC in
humans—i.e., the study of how the body
interacts with D9-THC—have been
evaluated following inhaled
administration of marijuana and oral
administration of marijuana. These are
the most frequently used routes of
administration for marijuana or isolated
D9-THC. HHS Basis for Rec. at 21.
Marijuana is commonly administered
by humans via inhalation through
smoking and, more recently, through
vaping (e.g., heating and inhalation of

18The United States Pharmacopoeia was formed
as an ‘‘independent, scientific, non-profit
organization dedicated to public health’’ that
published ‘‘a national, uniform set of guidelines for
the best understood medicinal substances and
preparations of the day.’’ Building Trust for Over
200 Years: A Timeline of USP, U.S. Pharmacopoeia,

botanical matter or other volatile
substances containing D9-THC).
Generally, inhalation of a drug is the
route that produces the fastest rate of
drug absorption. Once marijuana is
inhaled, D9-THC is absorbed through
the lungs in the form of an aerosol
within seconds. Peak plasma levels of
D9-THC following inhalation occur very
quickly, within 6 to 10 minutes.
Psychoactive effects begin immediately
following absorption, although peak
subjective effects do not coincide with
peak plasma D9-THC levels and are
often delayed. Following administration
of marijuana through inhalation, the
bioavailability of D9-THC is 10 percent
to 35 percent. That bioavailability is
relatively low and varies widely due to
several factors. An individual’s
experience and technique with smoking
marijuana also determines the dose
absorbed. HHS Basis for Rec. at 22.
When marijuana or D9-THC is
administered orally (such as by eating
marijuana-infused foods), the effects
start within 30 to 90 minutes, reach
their peak at 1.5 to 3 hours, and remain
measurable for 4 to 12 hours. Oral
bioavailability of D9-THC, following
ingestion of an edible containing
marijuana or isolated D9-THC, ranges
from 5 to 20 percent. The low and
variable bioavailability of D9-THC from
oral ingestion is a consequence of its
first-pass hepatic elimination from
blood and erratic absorption from
stomach and bowel. Ingestion of
brownies containing marijuana also
results in lower D9-THC plasma levels
relative to inhalation of marijuana. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 22–23.
Although there are differences in
absorption of D9-THC depending on
route of administration, the distribution,
metabolism, and excretion of D9-THC is
similar regardless of how the drug is
administered. Plasma concentrations of
D9-THC decrease quickly after
absorption through rapid distribution
into tissues and through liver
metabolism. Because D9-THC has high
lipophilicity, the apparent volume of
distribution of D9-THC is high (10 L/kg)
as it is distributed initially into organs
such as lung, heart, brain, and liver that
are highly perfused. Over time with
regular exposure to marijuana, D9-THC
will concentrate and be retained in fat.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 23.
Metabolism of D9-THC occurs
primarily via cytochrome P450
isozymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and
CYP3A4) via microsomal hydroxylation
to both active and inactive metabolites.
The primary active metabolite of D9-
THC is 11-hydroxy-D9-THC. D9-THC
clears from the blood relatively rapidly,
largely because it is redistributed to
other tissues in the body. Metabolism of
D9-THC in most tissues is relatively
slow or absent. The majority of the
absorbed D9-THC dose is eliminated in
feces, and about 33 percent in urine.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 23.
HHS Conclusion With Respect to
Factor 3
In conclusion, HHS found that the
pharmacokinetic profile of marijuana
varies greatly depending on route of
administration. Inhalation of marijuana
produces a rapid increase in plasma
levels of D9-THC and an immediate
onset of psychological effects. In
comparison, oral administration of
marijuana produces a much slower
increase in plasma levels of D9-THC and
onset of psychological effects. Once D9-
THC has been absorbed, however, the
metabolism and excretion of D9-THC
follows a standard path. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 24.
DEA likewise notes that there is
considerable variability in the
cannabinoid concentrations and
chemical constituency among marijuana
samples and that the interpretation of
clinical data related to marijuana is
complicated. A primary issue is the lack
of consistent concentrations of D9-THC
and other substances in marijuana,
which complicates the interpretation of
the effects of different marijuana
constituents. Additionally, the noncannabinoid components in marijuana
may potentially modify the overall
pharmacological and toxicological
properties of various marijuana strains
and products. DEA anticipates that
additional data on other marijuana
constituents, routes of administration of
marijuana, and the impact on D9-THC
potency may be appropriate for
consideration.
4. Marijuana’s History and Current
Pattern of Abuse
The fourth factor that DOJ and HHS
must consider under 21 U.S.C. 811(c) is
marijuana’s history and current pattern
of abuse, which can include its abuse
relative to relevant comparator
substances that are abused. See HHS
Basis for Rec. at 28–37. HHS concluded
that it is appropriate to consider the
Federal- and State-level history of
marijuana control, marijuana sources for
nonmedical and medical use, marijuana
use in the United States since passage
of the CSA, and current patterns of use
and abuse of marijuana. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 28.
Federal History of Marijuana Control
According to HHS, marijuana was
described in the United States
Pharmacopoeia 18 as early as 1850.
Around the time that Congress passed
the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906,
Public Law 59–384, 34 Stat. 768, drugs
such as marijuana, alcohol, heroin,
morphine, and cocaine began to be
characterized by the Federal
Government as addictive and
dangerous. These drugs were frequently
included in patent medicines, often
without the consumer’s knowledge. The
1906 law required accurate drug
labeling with respect to ingredients and
dosage. But it did not prohibit the sale
or possession of drugs characterized as
addictive and dangerous drugs,
including marijuana. As nonmedical use
of marijuana and opioids became more
popular in the United States, Congress
provided funding in 1929 for two
‘‘narcotic farms’’ in Lexington,
Kentucky, and Fort Worth, Texas, which
were medical treatment centers run by
the Public Health Service for federal
prisoners who were ‘‘habitual users of
narcotics,’’ including marijuana-derived
products. HHS Basis for Rec. at 28–29.
In the first half of the twentieth
century, marijuana use was curbed by
several Federal laws. In 1931, the
importation of marijuana into the
United States began to be restricted
under regulations under the Pure Food
and Drug Act, except for medicinal
purposes. The Marihuana Tax Act of
1937, Public Law 75–238, 50 Stat. 551,
imposed taxes that effectively
prohibited marijuana use for medical,
nonmedical, scientific, or industrial
purposes. Five years later, in 1942,
marijuana was removed from the United
States Pharmacopoeia. Through the
imposition of mandatory minimums, the
Boggs Act of 1951, Public Law 82–255,
65 Stat. 767, lengthened the average
sentence for first time marijuana
offenders to 2 to 5 years, similar to that
for opioid offenses, regardless of
whether the individual was a
nonmedical user or a trafficker. The
Narcotic Control Act of 1956, Public
Law 84–728, 70 Stat. 567, increased the
minimum sentence for a first offender
for marijuana to 2 to 10 years. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 29.
Despite the legal consequences,
nonmedical marijuana use increased
dramatically in the 1960s, especially
among youth. Congress passed the CSA
in 1970. The CSA effectively repealed

all previous Federal drug laws,
including the Marihuana Tax Act, and
provided a unified framework for
control of drugs with abuse potential.
When the CSA was enacted, marijuana
was placed into schedule I, which
prohibited use of marijuana for
medicinal or nonmedical purposes other
than legitimate scientific research and
analysis. This placement was consistent
with the criteria established by the CSA
under 21 U.S.C. 812. HHS Basis for Rec.
at 29–30.
Marijuana Control at the State Level
According to HHS, changes in Statelevel marijuana laws in the United
States in the modern era began in 1996
with the approval of Proposition 215,
the Compassionate Use Act, by voters in
California. This law legalized the use,
possession, and cultivation of marijuana
for treatment of patients with cancer,
anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity,
glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any
other illness for which marijuana
provides relief, when recommended by
a physician. Under the law, marijuana
could also be cultivated by patient
caregivers. HHS Basis for Rec. at 30.
As of August 2023, when HHS
submitted its Basis for Recommendation
to DEA, State-level laws allowing
medicinal use of marijuana had been
passed in a total of 38 States, plus the
District of Columbia: Alabama, Alaska,
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Delaware, District of
Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,
Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New Mexico, New York, North Dakota,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah,
Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and
West Virginia. Medical use of marijuana
was legalized through the action of 20
State legislatures and by 18 ballot
measures.19 HHS Basis for Rec. at 30.
In 2012, Colorado and Washington
became the first States to legalize the
nonmedical use of marijuana. As of
August 2023, State-level legalization of
the nonmedical use of marijuana has
occurred in a total of 23 States and the
District of Columbia: Alaska, Arizona,
California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New
Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode
Island, Vermont, Virginia, and
Washington. Nonmedical use of
marijuana was legalized by ballot
initiatives in 13 States and by State
legislatures in 9 States. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 30.
Marijuana Use in the United States
Since Passage of the CSA
Marijuana use has varied since the
CSA was passed in 1970. Gallup Poll
data from 1969 to 2013 show a steady
increase over time in affirmative
responses to whether the respondent
had personally tried marijuana, with
only 4 percent of people saying they had
tried marijuana in 1969 compared to 38
percent in 2013. As HHS observed, the
2017 NASEM report stated that the
prevalence of marijuana use peaked in
the late 1970s, declined through the
1980s, and then increased again in the
mid-1990s. From 2007 to 2017, there
were steady year-over-year increases in
the share of the general population that
used marijuana in the past month,
although there is no clear explanation
for the post-2007 increase in use rates.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 31–32.
Current Patterns of Use and Abuse of
Marijuana
In considering current patterns of use
and abuse of marijuana and marijuanaderived products, HHS analyzed
epidemiological databases from 2015 to
the most recent years of available data
(which vary among data sources). A
wide variety of epidemiological
databases provide necessary data for
HHS’s analyses. These include the
NSDUH; Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (‘‘BRFSS’’);
Research Abuse, Diversion and
Addiction-Related Surveillance
(‘‘RADARS’’); Nonmedical Use of
Prescription Drugs (‘‘NMURx’’);
Monitoring the Future (‘‘MTF’’); Youth
Risk Behavioral Surveillance System
(‘‘YRBSS’’); and International Cannabis
Policy Study (‘‘ICPS’’). HHS Basis for
Rec. at 32.
National Survey on Drug Use and
Health
Based on NSDUH data, HHS
concluded that from 2015 to 2019 the
past-year use of marijuana for any
reason (nonmedical and medical) among
people ages 12 years and older
increased from 14 percent to 18 percent.
By contrast, past-year (nonmedical and
medical) use of comparator drugs that
have FDA-approved therapeutic
indications declined or remained
relatively stable over the same
timeframe, including hydrocodone (22
percent to 16 percent), benzodiazepines
(12 percent to 11 percent, 2017 to 2019
only), oxycodone (11 percent to 9
percent), tramadol (7 percent to 6
percent), zolpidem (4 percent to 3
percent), and ketamine (less than 1
percent). Although there were trend
breaks for the years 2020 and 2021,20
marijuana past-year use continued to
increase during these two years. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 32–33.
Based on NSDUH data, HHS
concluded that from 2015 to 2019, the
prevalence of past-year nonmedical use
of marijuana (i.e., use without a health
care provider (‘‘HCP’’) recommendation)
among people ages 12 years and older
also increased. HHS’s finding was based
on an increase in the prevalence of
overall nonmedical use of marijuana
from 12 percent to 15 percent and on an
increase in nonmedical use of marijuana
only, without nonmedical use of other
drugs that are abused, from 8 percent to
11 percent during this period. There
was a slight decrease in both categories
in 2020, but the prevalence of both
kinds of uses increased again in 2021 (to
16 percent and 11 percent, respectively)
to levels that were higher than those
reported in 2019. In contrast, the
prevalence of past-year nonmedical use
of comparator drugs was less than 3
percent for heroin, cocaine, oxycodone,
hydrocodone, tramadol,
benzodiazepines, and zolpidem, which
is much less than that for marijuana,
either alone or with other drugs. Over
the 2015 to 2021 reporting period, the
overall use of these comparator drugs
declined slightly or remained fairly
stable. Notably, the majority of
individuals who reported nonmedical
use of marijuana did not report
nonmedical use of the comparator
drugs. And over the same reporting
period of 2015 to 2021, the prevalence
of past-year use of alcohol ranged from
62 percent to 65 percent for individuals
ages 12 years and older, far exceeding
the prevalence for marijuana or other
comparator drugs. These data
demonstrate that alcohol has the highest
prevalence of past-year-only use,
followed by nonmedical use of
marijuana. The prevalence of the other
comparators is far below that of alcohol
and marijuana. HHS Basis for Rec. at 33.
HHS also concluded that the NSDUH
data show that most individuals who
used marijuana in the past year did not
do so based on a recommendation from
an HCP, but marijuana use was more
frequent among users with an HCP

recommendation. The yearly percentage
of individuals who used marijuana but
did not have an HCP recommendation
ranged between 84 and 89 percent
between 2015 and 2021; by comparison,
exclusive medical use of marijuana that
was recommended by an HCP ranged
between 7 and 10 percent of marijuana
users in the same period. According to
HHS, approximately 50 percent of those
individuals without an HCP
recommendation used marijuana for 60
or fewer days in the year, while 29
percent used marijuana for more than
241 days in the year. In contrast, for
those individuals whose use of
marijuana was sometimes or always
recommended by an HCP, 51 percent
and 55 percent (respectively) used
marijuana at least 241 days in the year.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 33–34.
The NSDUH data from 2021 showed
that among individuals who used any
marijuana in the past year, 69 percent
used marijuana in the prior month. For
comparator drugs, the percentage of
individuals with past-year use who used
each substance nonmedically in the past
month was 76 percent for alcohol, 49
percent for heroin, 38 percent for
cocaine, and 28 percent for ketamine.

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System
BRFSS is a national, State-based,
cross-sectional telephone survey
conducted by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (‘‘CDC’’). The
participants in the 2021 BRFSS module
for marijuana included approximately
68 million individuals 18 years and
older, residing in 24 States and
Territories: Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland,
Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada,
New Hampshire, New York, North
Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island,
Utah, Vermont, Wyoming, and Guam.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 34.
For the 2021 survey year, the
estimated prevalence of past-month
marijuana use for any reason in the
BRFSS survey was 12 percent, with 88
percent reporting no marijuana use.
Among those with past-month
marijuana use, the mean frequency of
use was 17 days per month, with half of
respondents reporting that they used
marijuana 20 to 30 days per month. This
pattern was consistent across all age and
sex categories. HHS Basis for Rec. at 34.
When the reason for use was
evaluated, the percentage of individuals
who reported use for both medical and
nonmedical reasons was 39 percent,
compared to 36 percent for those who
reported use for nonmedical reasons
only, and 25 percent for those who
reported use for medical reasons only.
Those individuals who reported pastmonth use of marijuana for medical
reasons were more likely to be adults 55
years and older, while individuals who
reported past-month marijuana use for
nonmedical reasons only were more
likely to be younger adults aged 18 to
24 years. HHS Basis for Rec. at 34.
Individuals who reported using
marijuana in the past 30 days for both
nonmedical and medical reasons were
more likely (62 percent) to report
marijuana use near daily (20 to 30 days
per month) than individuals who
reported marijuana use for nonmedical
reasons only (34 percent). Similarly,
individuals who used marijuana for
medical reasons only were also more
likely (57 percent) to report near daily
use than those who used it for
nonmedical reasons only. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 34.
Researched Abuse, Diversion and
Addiction-Related Surveillance System
Survey of Nonmedical Use of
Prescription Drugs
The RADARS System conducts the
NMURx Program, a serial, crosssectional, online survey of the general
adult population (18 years and older) to
elicit information on the nonmedical
use of drugs (prescription,
nonprescription, unapproved, and
illicit). The NMURx Program estimates
represent measures of past-year drug use
in an enriched sample of United States
adults with higher-than-average
nonmedical use of prescription pain
relievers and illicit drugs. NMURx
program data demonstrated that pastyear use of marijuana was reported by
21 percent of individuals, while pastyear use of comparator substances was
substantially lower: benzodiazepines (4
percent), hydrocodone, oxycodone,
tramadol (2 percent), cocaine or crack
(less than 2 percent), and illicit fentanyl,
heroin, and ketamine (less than 1
percent). This pattern of much greater
marijuana use compared to other drugs
is consistent with the patterns reported
in NSDUH and BRFSS. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 35.
Monitoring the Future
MTF collects information on the use
of selected prescription and illicit drugs
and alcohol by conducting an annual,
nationally representative, crosssectional survey of 8th, 10th, and 12th
graders in public and private schools.21
MTF data showed that during the years
2012 to 2022, the illicit drug most
frequently used by 12th-grade students
who reported past-year drug use was
marijuana/hashish (approximately 35
percent per year from 2012 to 2020,
with a reduction to 30 percent per year
in 2021 and 2022). In contrast, in 2022,
alcohol was used by 52 percent of 12thgrade students within the last 12
months, similar to percentages in 2019
and 2020 (52 percent and 55 percent,
respectively), but higher than the 2021
level of 47 percent. All other comparator
drugs (hydrocodone, heroin, tramadol,
cocaine, ketamine, and zolpidem) were
each used in the past year by fewer than
5 percent of 12th graders from 2012 to
2022. HHS Basis for Rec. at 35.
MTF data for past-month use showed
a similar pattern. During the years 2012
to 2022, the illicit drug most frequently
used by 12th-grade students who
reported past-month drug use was
marijuana/hashish (approximately 20 to
22 percent per year) compared to pastmonth use of cocaine (approximately 1
percent per year) or heroin (less than 0.5
percent per year). However, past-month
alcohol use by 12th-grade students (28
percent) exceeded that of marijuana in
2022. For those who used marijuana in
the past month, 6 to 7 percent used it
daily. By comparison, for those who
used cocaine and heroin in the last
month, less than one percent used it
daily. MTF does not provide past-month
use data for hydrocodone, heroin,
tramadol, ketamine, or zolpidem. HHS

Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance
System
YRBSS was established by the CDC
and conducts school-based surveys
every 2 years, in partnership with State,
local, Territorial, and Tribal
governments, with a focus on youth
health behavior in the United States.
The YRBSS high school component, the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey, includes a
nationally representative survey of 9ththrough 12th-grade students. YRBSS
data showed that from 2009 to 2019,
approximately 20 percent of students in
9th through 12th grade reported using
marijuana at least once in the past
month during each year evaluated.
When students 17 years and older were
asked how old they were when they first
used marijuana, 43 percent reported
they initiated use between the ages of 15
to 16 years, 25 percent initiated use
between the ages of 13 to 14 years, and
13 percent initiated use at 12 years of
age and younger. YRBSS data also
showed, however, that past-month
alcohol use by high school students (29
percent) in 2019 was greater than that of
marijuana use, while past month

HHS Basis for Rec. at 36.
International Cannabis Policy Study
ICPS conducted serial, cross-sectional
surveys from 2019 to 2021 of
individuals ages 16 to 65 years living in
the United States to understand the
public health impact of marijuana
legalization. HHS’s evaluation of that
survey data focused on respondents
who reported at least some past-year
marijuana nonmedical use (by
indicating that they were not a medical
marijuana user, defined as someone
who uses marijuana only to treat a
medical condition). HHS Basis for Rec.
at 36.
According to HHS, ICPS data showed
that the prevalence of past-year
nonmedical use of marijuana ranged
from 18 percent to 22 percent of
individuals surveyed from 2019 to 2021,
while the prevalence of past-month
nonmedical use was lower, ranging from
12 percent to 14 percent of individuals
surveyed. Individuals aged 26 to 34
years had the highest relative
prevalence of nonmedical marijuana
use, with 26 percent reporting past-year
use and 18 percent reporting past-month
use. When those individuals who
reported past-year marijuana use in
2021 were asked why they used the
drug, 33 percent reported use for
medical reasons, while 61 percent were
classified as using marijuana for
nonmedical reasons only. (The other 6
percent did not respond.) HHS Basis for
Rec. at 36.
When frequency of nonmedical use of
marijuana was evaluated in ICPS for
those individuals who used marijuana
nonmedically at least once a year,
individuals aged 16 to 17 years had the
highest percentage of use less than once
a month (approximately 40 percent,
compared to approximately 25 to 31
percent for other age cohorts); while
individuals aged 26 to 34 years had the
highest percentage of daily use
(approximately 43 percent, compared to
approximately 34 to 37 percent for
individuals in other adult cohorts and
approximately 24 percent among
individuals 16 and 17 years). Among
individuals who used marijuana for
nonmedical reasons in the past year, 49
percent reported never using alcohol
and marijuana at the same time, while
35 percent sometimes used the two
substances together, 9 percent often
used them together, and 5 percent used
alcohol every time they used marijuana.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 36–37.
HHS Conclusion With Respect to
Factor 4
In light of the evidence cited above,
HHS determined that certain
conclusions could be drawn about
marijuana’s current pattern of abuse.
HHS concluded that the use of
marijuana for medical and nonmedical
purposes is extensive in the United
States. HHS also concluded that the
prevalence of marijuana use is less than
that of alcohol and significantly more
than that of other drugs of abuse that are
scheduled under the CSA. Specifically,
HHS noted that NSDUH data from 2015
to 2019 showed that the prevalence of
past-year use of alcohol was five to six
times greater than that of nonmedical
use of marijuana. In contrast, the
prevalence of past-year nonmedical use
of heroin, cocaine, oxycodone,
hydrocodone, tramadol,
benzodiazepines, and zolpidem was
four to five times less than that of
marijuana nonmedical use. Similar pastyear comparative drug use data were
reported in RADARS–NMURx, MTF,
and ICPS. HHS Basis for Rec. at 37. In
2016, DEA found that marijuana
continues to be the most widely used
illicit drug. It noted that in 2014, there
were 22.2 million current users; that
there were also 2.6 million new users,
most of whom were less than 18 years
of age; and that marijuana was the most
frequently identified drug identified in
Federal, State, and local forensic
laboratories. 81 FR 53739. In addition to
the data provided in the HHS Basis for
Recommendation and the data
considered by HHS and DEA in their
2015 eight-factor analyses, DEA
anticipates that additional information
arising from this rulemaking will further
inform the findings that must be made
to reschedule marijuana, including with
respect to this factor. DEA also notes
that, according to the World Health
Organization, cannabis is globally the
most commonly used psychoactive
substance under international control.22
Accounting for half of all drug seizures
worldwide, the global annual
prevalence of cannabis consumption is
2.5 percent or about 147 million
people.23 In 2016, an estimated 28.6
million individuals age 12 or older were
current (in the past month) illicit drug
users.24 By 2020, approximately 59.3
million individuals age 12 or older
reported using an illicit drug within the
past year; 83.6 percent (49.6 million) of
those past-year illicit drug users
reported using marijuana.25 In 2022, the
Domestic Cannabis Eradication and
Suppression Program was responsible
for the eradication of 4,435,859 illegally
cultivated outdoor cannabis plants and
1,245,980 illegally cultivated indoor
plants for a total of 5,681,839 illegally
cultivated marijuana plants.26 DEA
believes that additional data on
marijuana’s pattern of abuse may be
appropriate for consideration in
assessing this factor.
5. The Scope, Duration, and
Significance of Abuse
The fifth factor that DOJ and HHS
must consider under 21 U.S.C. 811(c) is
the scope, duration, and significance of
marijuana abuse. In conducting its
analysis, HHS analyzed the
consequences over time of marijuana
abuse compared to the abuse of other
substances based on data from the
United States Poison Centers National
Poison Data System (‘‘NPDS’’), NSDUH,
the Treatment Episode Data Set
(‘‘TEDS’’), the National Addictions
Vigilance Intervention and Prevention
Program (‘‘NAVIPPRO’’), the National
Emergency Department Sample
(‘‘NEDS’’), the National Inpatient
Sample (‘‘NIS’’), and the National
Forensic Laboratory Information System
(‘‘NFLIS’’). HHS Basis for Rec. at 37–45.

of Marijuana Abuse
National Poison Data System
Data from NPDS provide information
on the scope of contacts with a poison
center (‘‘PC’’) following marijuana abuse
relative to abuse of selected
comparators. HHS Basis for Rec. at 38.
The number of PC abuse cases for a
substance (either alone or in
combination with another substance) for
the period of 2015 to 2021 showed that
the highest number of PC abuse cases
was for alcohol, followed by heroin and

then benzodiazepines. The fourth
highest number of PC abuse cases was
for marijuana, with all other
comparators showing fewer PC abuse
cases. When the PC abuse cases for 2015
to 2021 were analyzed for cases
involving a single substance only, the
rank order of PC abuse cases by number
was the same as the order from all PC
abuse cases for substances used alone or
in combination with another substance,
meaning that marijuana accounted for
the fourth highest number of PC abuse
cases for a single substance. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 38.
HHS’s analysis of the data from 2015
to 2021 showed cases resulting from
abuse (as opposed to those resulting
from other causes, such as accidental
ingestion) made up the largest
proportion of PC cases for illicit
fentanyl (72 percent), heroin (65
percent), cocaine (41 percent) and
ketamine (40 percent). The fifth highest
percentage was for cases involving
marijuana (36 percent), followed by
alcohol (15 percent), oxycodone (13
percent), benzodiazepines (8 percent),
hydrocodone (5 percent), tramadol (4
percent), and zolpidem (3 percent). A
similar analysis for single-substanceonly abuse for the same period showed
that the three substances most likely to
lead to a PC call following abuse were
heroin (65 percent), oxycodone (47
percent), and tramadol (47 percent). The
fourth highest percentage was for
marijuana and ketamine (46 percent),
followed by alcohol (43 percent),
zolpidem (40 percent), hydrocodone (37
percent), illicit fentanyl (34 percent),
benzodiazepines (32 percent), and
cocaine (28 percent). HHS Basis for Rec.
at 38.
Annual utilization-adjusted abuse
case rates were calculated by dividing
the number of PC abuse case counts by
the prevalence of past-year use based on
NSDUH estimates from people aged 12
years and older, for the period 2015 to
2019, for both (1) any past-year use of
the substance and (2) past-year
nonmedical use of the substance. These
utilization-adjusted rates convey the
likelihood that use of a drug will result
in PC abuse cases when considering
how many people use the drug for either
(1) any reason or (2) nonmedical
reasons. The utilization-adjusted abuse
rates for any past-year use of a substance
showed the highest rate for heroin
(increasing from 4,038 to 7,201 cases per
one million people). The next highest
rates were for ketamine, cocaine, and
benzodiazepines; all these rates were
considerably lower than the rate for
heroin. The rates for marijuana
(relatively stable at 75 to 70 cases per
one million people) and oxycodone
were similar, as were the rates for
alcohol, zolpidem, tramadol, and
hydrocodone; all these rates were
considerably lower than the rates for
ketamine, cocaine, and
benzodiazepines. A similar pattern of
utilization-adjusted abuse rates was
seen among cases involving a single
substance only during the same time
period. HHS Basis for Rec. at 39.
An analysis of medical outcomes
related to exposure based on severity,
timing, and assessment of clinical
effects for all single-substance PC abuse
cases involving marijuana or comparator
drugs showed that serious medical
outcomes (moderate effect, major effect,
or death) were greatest for illicit
fentanyl (81 percent) and heroin (79
percent), followed by oxycodone (70
percent), ketamine (64 percent),
tramadol (62 percent), cocaine (59
percent), hydrocodone (44 percent),
marijuana (41 percent), benzodiazepines
(32 percent), alcohol (31 percent), and
zolpidem (27 percent). HHS noted that
death rates are underreported in NPDS,
but HHS observed that the highest death
rate was for fentanyl (25 percent);
cocaine, heroin, and alcohol had
comparatively very low death rates (3
percent, 2 percent, and 2 percent,
respectively), with all other comparators
reporting death rates of less than 1
percent. HHS Basis for Rec. at 39–40.
National Survey on Drug Use and
Health
Data from NSDUH provide nationally
representative information on the
prevalence of substance use disorder
(‘‘SUD’’) in 2021 among individuals
aged 12 years or older who reported
nonmedical use of marijuana in past
year in comparison to heroin, cocaine,
or alcohol use in the past year. A
diagnosis of SUD is made when an
individual endorses at least 2 of the 11
criteria for SUD according to the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (‘‘DSM–
V’’). Individuals are classified with a
mild SUD if they meet two to three of
the criteria, a moderate SUD if they
meet four to five of the criteria, and a
severe SUD if they meet six or more of
the criteria. HHS Basis for Rec. at 40.
NSDUH data showed that, among
individuals with past-year heroin use in
2021, there was an 81 percent
prevalence of meeting the criteria for a
heroin SUD. In comparison, there was a
30 percent prevalence of meeting the
criteria for marijuana SUD among
individuals who used marijuana for
nonmedical reasons only (17 percent
mild, 8 percent moderate, and 5 percent
severe). For individuals who used
marijuana for nonmedical purposes and
did not use other drugs illicitly, there
was a slightly lower prevalence (24
percent) of meeting the criteria for SUD
(15 percent mild, 6 percent moderate,
and 3 percent severe). For cocaine, 30
percent of individuals who used cocaine
in the past year met criteria for cocaine
SUD (13 percent mild, 5 percent
moderate, and 12 percent severe). For
individuals who used alcohol in the
past year, the prevalence of alcohol SUD
was 17 percent (10 percent mild, 4
percent moderate, and 3 percent severe).
HHS Basis for Rec. at 40.
Although the 2021 NSDUH data
showed that the likelihood of meeting
the criteria for a SUD was highest for
heroin, followed by marijuana, cocaine,
and alcohol, the absolute number of
individuals who met the criteria had a
different order. Alcohol had the highest
number of such individuals
(approximately 29,544,000), followed by
marijuana (approximately 13,078,000
people with marijuana nonmedical-only
use, and approximately 7,454,000 with
nonmedical-only use and no
nonmedical use of other drugs), cocaine
(approximately 1,408,000), and heroin
(approximately 894,000). HHS Basis for

Treatment Episode Data Set
TEDS is a database run by SAMHSA
within HHS that presents information
on the demographic and substance use
characteristics of annual admissions for
treatment for alcohol and drug abuse in
State-approved facilities that are
required by the States to provide TEDS
client-level data. Because TEDS is based
only on reports from these facilities,
TEDS data do not represent the total
national demand for substance abuse
treatment or the prevalence of substance
abuse in the general population. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 40–41.
Out of 1.4 million admissions
documented in the 2020 TEDS dataset,
the most frequently reported primary
drug of admission was alcohol (31
percent, or 442,014 admissions),
followed by heroin (21 percent, or
292,126 admissions), marijuana (10
percent, or 139,481 admissions), and
cocaine (5 percent, or 71,725
admissions). Other comparator drugs
were each reported as the primary drug
in less than 2 percent of admissions.
Over the reporting period of 2015 to
2020, the proportion of admissions each
year ranged from 30 to 33 percent for
alcohol; from 21 to 26 percent for
heroin; from 10 to 14 percent for
marijuana; and from 5 to 6 percent for
cocaine. The proportion of admissions
with marijuana as the primary drug
declined each year from 14 percent in
2015 to a low of 10 percent in 2020,

slightly during this time from 5 percent
in 2015 to 6 percent in 2019. During this
reporting period, other comparator
drugs were each reported as the primary
drug in less than 2 percent of
admissions each year. HHS Basis for

In 2020, marijuana and cocaine were
most likely to be reported as the
secondary drug at admission (25 percent
and 24 percent, respectively), followed
by alcohol (15 percent), heroin (8
percent), and benzodiazepines (6
percent), with all other comparators
reported as less than 2 percent. For
tertiary drugs at admission, marijuana
(29 percent) was reported most
frequently, followed by cocaine (18
percent), alcohol (16 percent), and
heroin (5 percent), with all other
comparators reported as less than 2
percent. HHS Basis for Rec. at 41.

Nationwide Emergency Department
Sample
NEDS is the largest all-payer ED
database in the United States, as
developed for HHS’s Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality
(‘‘AHRQ’’). NEDS is a sample of records
from ED visits from the State Emergency
Department Databases, which capture
discharge information on all ED visits
that do not result in hospital admission,
and the State Inpatient Databases, which
contain information on patients first
seen in the ED and then admitted. The
2020 ED sample covered 995 hospital
EDs and 41 States; the unweighted 2020
sample contained data from over 28
million ED visits, which resulted in a
weighted estimate of 123 million ED
visits. HHS compared ED visits that
noted an alcohol, marijuana, or cocainerelated disorder; this comparison
included ED visits not directly due to a
specific substance-related disorder, but
in which the patient was recorded as
having had an alcohol, marijuana, or
cocaine-related disorder in the
administrative claim associated with the
visit. HHS Basis for Rec. at 42.
Based on NEDS data, from 2016 to
2020, the highest estimated number of
annual ED visits was for an alcoholrelated disorder, with between 4 million
and 4.1 million visits each year, 3.2
million of which involved alcohol as a
single substance. Over the same
timeframe, estimated annual ED visits
involving a marijuana-related disorder
ranged from approximately 1.3 million
to over 1.7 million, with the estimated
annual ED visits for single-substance
marijuana disorder ranging from
757,731 to 1.08 million. For cocaine, the
estimated annual ED visits involving a
related disorder were between 559,165
and 774,737, with annual visits for
single-substance cocaine-related
disorder ranging from 204,257 to
266,614. HHS Basis for Rec. at 42.
HHS calculated a utilization-adjusted
rate of estimated ED visits, and the
highest rate was for cocaine-related
disorder, which ranged from 11,765 to
14,014 visits per 100,000 individuals, of
which 4,011 to 4,952 were singlesubstance visits. Marijuana had the
second-highest utilization-adjusted rate
of estimated ED visits, ranging from
3,472 to 3,940 per 100,000 individuals
2,017 to 2,413 of which were singlesubstance visits. The utilizationadjusted rate of visits involving an
alcohol disorder, the lowest of the three
substances, ranged from 2,225 to 2,327
per 100,000 individuals, of which 1,775
to 1,843 were single-substance ED visits.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 42–43.
National Inpatient Sample
NIS is the largest publicly available
all-payer inpatient administrative health
care database in the United States, and
it is sponsored by AHRQ. It is a sample
of discharges from participating
community hospitals from 46 to 48
States and the District of Columbia each
year, with approximately 7 million
unweighted inpatient stays annually,
accounting for weighted annual
estimates of 35 million hospitalizations.
HHS used NIS data to compare alcohol,
marijuana, and cocaine. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 43.
From 2016 to 2020, alcohol-related
disorder had the highest estimated
annual number of hospitalizations, at
approximately 1.8 million each year, of
which approximately 1.2 to 1.25 million
involved single-substance alcoholrelated disorder. Marijuana-related
disorder had the second-highest
estimated annual number of
hospitalizations, increasing from
795,140 in 2016 to 914,810 in 2020, of
which 373,160 to 452,985 were for
single-substance marijuana-related
disorder. Cocaine had the lowest
estimated annual number of
hospitalizations, ranging from 387,385
to 453,955, of which 94,695 to 112,725
were for single-substance cocainerelated disorder. HHS Basis for Rec. at
43.
HHS then calculated a utilizationadjusted rate of estimated
hospitalizations, and the highest rate
was for cocaine-related disorder, which
ranged from 7,185 to 8,211
hospitalizations per 100,000 individuals
with any past-year use, of which 1,796
to 2,039 were single-substance
hospitalizations. Marijuana-related
disorder had the second-highest rate of
estimated hospitalizations, ranging from
1,850 to 2,117 per 100,000 individuals,
of which 906 to 1,026 were singlesubstance hospitalizations. Alcohol had
the lowest rate, ranging from 987 to
1,039 per 100,000 individuals, of which
675 to 715 were single-substance
hospitalizations. HHS Basis for Rec. at

National Forensic Laboratory
Information System
NFLIS is a program of the Diversion
Control Division of DEA. The NFLISDrug system is a component of the
NFLIS that contains data that serve as a
surveillance resource to monitor drug
encounters by law enforcement across
the United States, including data on
drugs seized by law enforcement and
submitted to Federal, State, and local
forensic laboratories for analysis. In
NFLIS, a law enforcement investigation
(‘‘case’’) may result in one or more
‘‘reports’’ or ‘‘exhibits’’ of drug
evidence, and each report or exhibit
may contain one drug or multiple drugs.
However, NFLIS-Drug data has
limitations because not all drugs
encountered by law enforcement are
sent for analysis and not all drugs sent
to reporting forensic laboratories are
tested. To account for nonreporting

Analyzing national estimates data
allows for a comparison of the number
of reports by year and reporting trends.
In calculating national and regional
estimates, DEA uses all NFLIS-Drug
reporting laboratories. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 43–44.
In 2021, there were 1,326,205 drug
reports from State and local forensic
laboratories in the United States, an
increase of 3 percent from 2020.
Nationally, 61 percent of all drug
reports in NFLIS were identified as
involving methamphetamine (406,200
reports or 31 percent), cannabis/THC
(167,669 reports or 13 percent), cocaine
(165,162 reports or 12 percent), or
heroin (72,315 reports or 5 percent).
HHS Basis for Rec. at 44–45.
In 2021, there were 1,027,219 drugspecific cases submitted to and analyzed
by State and local laboratories, a 2
percent increase from 2020. Although
the total NFLIS-Drug number of drug
reports increased in 2021 from 2020, the
total number of cases and drugs
reported continues to be noticeably
lower than the numbers reported for the
years before the COVID–19 pandemic.
Nationally, in 2021, 45 percent of all
drug cases contained one or more
reports of methamphetamine, followed
by cocaine (18 percent), cannabis/THC
(17 percent), and heroin (8 percent).
Nationally, the number of cannabis/THC
reports as well as the number of cases
in which cannabis/THC was identified
decreased from 2015 through 2021,
including a decrease from 188,735 to
167,669 from 2020 to 2021. HHS noted
that this could mean there was a
decrease in the number of cannabis/
THC encounters, but it could also mean
that there was a decrease in the number
of exhibits submitted by law
enforcement for analysis or a decrease
in the number of exhibits processed
(analyzed) by forensic laboratories. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 45.
HHS Conclusion With Respect to
Factor 5
In HHS’s view, the most notable
conclusion from its evaluation of
epidemiological databases related to the
medical outcomes from drug abuse is
that, for all evaluated measures from
2015 to 2020, the rank order of
comparators in terms of greatest adverse
consequences typically placed alcohol
(unscheduled), heroin (schedule I), and
cocaine (schedule II) in the first or
immediately subsequent position, with
marijuana in a lower position. This
pattern also held for PC data for serious
medical outcomes, including death,
where marijuana was in the lowest
ranking group. HHS determined that
this demonstrated that there is
consistency across databases, across
substances, and over time, and that
although abuse of marijuana produces
clear evidence of harmful consequences,
including SUD, the consequences are
relatively less common and less harmful
than some other comparator drugs.
Additionally, HHS concluded, the
number of law enforcement encounters
with marijuana decreased from 2020 to
2021, at a time when law enforcement
encounters were increasing for other
scheduled drugs of abuse. However, as
it noted with respect to Factor 1.A, HHS
emphasized that there are limitations in
comparing descriptive data on adverse
outcomes across drugs, although
descriptive analyses of epidemiologic
data are an established practice in
previous eight-factor analyses. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 45.
In 2016, DEA found that abuse of
marijuana is widespread and significant.
81 FR 53739. In addition, DEA found in
2016 that a significant proportion of all
admissions for substance abuse
treatment are for marijuana/hashish as
the primary drug of abuse. Id. DEA
notes that national data demonstrate
that marijuana is one of the most widely
used federally illicit substances in the
United States, consistent with findings
from the HHS Basis for
Recommendation. According to the
NSDUH, in 2022, among people aged 12
or older in the United States, an
estimated 61.9 million people (22
percent) had used marijuana in the past
year, and 42.3 million (15.0 percent)
had used it in the past month. DEA
notes that, according to one National
Institutes of Health-supported study, the
prevalence of daily marijuana use
reached its highest level reported in
2021, at 11 percent of Americans aged
12 or older, a 3 percent increase from
2017 and a 5 percent increase from
2012.27 It also notes that the average
percentage of D9-THC in seized
marijuana has increased over time.28
Also, TEDS data showed that, in 2020,
marijuana was the primary drug of
admission in approximately 10 percent
of all admissions to substance abuse
treatment among patients aged 12 and
older. HHS Basis for Rec. at 41, 46. DEA
also notes that TEDS data for 2021
reported that marijuana/hashish was the
primary substance of abuse in 10.2
percent of all admissions to substance
abuse treatment among patients aged 12
and older.29 The 2021 TEDS data further
reported that New York, California,
Georgia, North Carolina, New Jersey,
Texas, Minnesota, South Carolina,
Florida, and Connecticut accounted for
55.9 percent of admissions to substance
use treatments services where
marijuana/hashish was listed as the
primary substance.30 DEA also believes
that additional information regarding
the scope, duration, and significance of
marijuana abuse may be appropriate for
consideration in assessing this factor.
6. What, if Any, Risk There Is to the
Public Health
The sixth factor that DOJ and HHS
must consider under 21 U.S.C. 811(c) is
the risk posed to the public health by
marijuana. In analyzing this factor, HHS
examined NSDUH data related to the
demographics of U.S. individuals
meeting criteria for marijuana use
disorder, TEDS data related to the
demographics of admission to treatment
centers for marijuana use disorder,
NEDS and NIS data on admissions to
EDs and hospitals related to marijuana
poisoning, ToxIC Core Registry data on
intentional and unintentional exposure,
and NPDS data describing the risks to
youth of unintentional exposure to
marijuana. HHS also assessed the risks
to the public health through NSDUH
data on driving under the influence of
marijuana in adults and high school
students. Finally, HHS reported data
regarding the risk of serious AEs and
death associated with nonmedical use/
use of uncertain intent of marijuana as
reported to the FDA Adverse Event
Reporting System, Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse
Event Reporting System, National Vital
Statistics System-Mortality (‘‘NVSS–
M’’), DAWN, FDA’s Sentinel Distributed
Database System, and Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, and as
reflected in the Drug-Involved Mortality
data linking NVSS–M to death
certificates. HHS Basis for Rec. at 46.

can be found at pages 46–57 of the HHS
Basis for Recommendation. In summary,
HHS found that the risks to the public
health posed by marijuana are low
compared to other drugs of abuse (e.g.,
heroin (schedule I), cocaine (schedule
II)), based on its evaluation of various
epidemiological databases for ED visits,
hospitalizations, unintentional
exposures, and, most importantly, for
overdose deaths. The rank order of
comparator drugs in terms of greatest
adverse consequences typically places
heroin, benzodiazepines, or cocaine in
the first or immediately subsequent
positions, with marijuana in a lower
place in the ranking, especially when
comparing among individuals who
reported using the respective drugs at
least once in the prior year. For
overdose deaths, marijuana is always
ranked the lowest among comparator
drugs. HHS interpreted these
evaluations to demonstrate that there is
consistent evidence across databases,
across substances, and over time that,
although the abuse of marijuana poses a
risk to public health, the risk is
relatively lower than that posed by most
other comparator drugs. However, as
HHS noted in its discussion of Factor 1,
see HHS Basis for Rec. at 7–8, there are
limitations in comparing descriptive
data on adverse outcomes across drugs.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 57.
In 2016, DEA found that, ‘‘[t]ogether
with the health risks outlined in terms
of pharmacological effects above, public
health risks from acute use of marijuana
include impaired psychomotor
performance, impaired driving, and
impaired performance on tests of
learning and associative processes.
Chronic use of marijuana poses a
number of other risks to the public
health including physical as well as
psychological dependence.’’ 81 FR
53739–40. In addition to the data
provided in the HHS Basis for
Recommendation and the data
considered by HHS and DEA in their
prior eight-factor analyses, DEA
anticipates that additional data on
public safety risks, risks from acute and
chronic marijuana use via oral and
inhaled administration routes, and the
impact of D9-THC potency may be
appropriate for consideration.
As discussed in the HHS Basis for
Recommendation, DEA notes that
studies have examined the risk
associated with marijuana use and
driving. HHS Basis for Rec. at 50. The
Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug
Trafficking Area reported in a
publication that traffic deaths in
Colorado in which drivers tested
positive for marijuana more than
doubled from 55 in 2013 to 131 in 2020,
although other evidence in the same
report suggests that driving under the
influence citations involving marijuana
have grown at a rate similar to the rate
for citations involving other drugs.31
DEA also identified some evidence
suggesting that, among drivers who test
positive for at least one drug in a traffic
stop, a growing share test positive for
cannabis.32
7. Marijuana’s Psychic or Physiological
Dependence Liability
The seventh factor that DOJ and HHS
are required to consider under 21 U.S.C.
811(c) is the psychic or physiologic
dependence liability of marijuana.
A. Psychic Dependence
The term ‘‘psychic or psychological
dependence’’ has been used to refer to
a state similar to addiction. For
diagnosis purposes, the DSM–V has
combined the diagnoses ‘‘abuse’’ and
‘‘drug dependence’’ (i.e., addiction),
which the DSM’s Fourth Edition
specified separately, into a single
‘‘substance use disorder,’’ which may
occur in a broad range of severity, from
mild to severe. HHS Basis for Rec. at 57.
The abuse potential of a drug can be
assessed, in part, by evaluating the
rewarding effects produced by that drug
in humans and animals. As HHS
described in its analysis of Factor 2, see
HHS Basis for Rec. at 12–13, rodent
behavioral studies show that D9-THC
produces both self-administration and
CPP. HHS determined that these results
demonstrate that D9-THC has rewarding
properties that are indicative of abuse
potential. Further, as HHS described in
its analysis of Factor 4, see HHS Basis
for Rec. at 32–37, there is ample
epidemiological evidence that
marijuana is self-administered by
humans, which may result from its
ability to produce rewarding
psychological effects, such as euphoria,
see HHS Basis for Rec. at 15. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 58.
In some individuals, extensive use of
marijuana can lead to SUD. HHS noted
that, in general, SUDs listed in the
DSM–V are defined by an inability to
cease drug use despite harmful
consequences; Cannabis Use Disorder
(‘‘CUD’’) shares this and other
diagnostic criteria common to SUDs for
other drugs of abuse. Estimates of CUD
in individuals who regularly use
marijuana vary and range from about 10
to 20 percent. These estimates are
similar to data from the United States
National Comorbidity Study, which
showed that 9 percent of lifetime
cannabis users met the criteria for
dependence outlined in the DSM’s
revised Third Edition at some time in
their life, compared to 32 percent of
tobacco users, 23 percent of opiate
users, and 15 percent of alcohol users.
The National Epidemiologic Survey on
Alcohol and Related Conditions also
reported a nine percent lifetime
cumulative probability of transitioning
from marijuana use to dependence, with
a higher risk of dependence in
individuals with a history of psychiatric
or other substance dependence
comorbidity. In the United States, data
from the 2020 NSDUH show that
approximately 14 million individuals
aged 12 or older who use marijuana or
other cannabinoid preparations met
criteria for CUD, representing 5.1
percent of all individuals aged 12 or
older meeting the NSDUH survey
inclusion criteria. HHS Basis for Rec. at
58.
Individuals who develop a SUD,
including CUD, may seek treatment.
From 2015 to 2020, TEDS documented
approximately 10.8 million treatment
episode admissions reported by
individuals treated at publicly funded
substance use treatment programs. Out
of 1.4 million treatment admissions
documented by TEDS in 2020,
marijuana was reported as the primary
substance of abuse in approximately 10
percent of admissions, making it the
third most frequently reported primary
substance of abuse, after alcohol (31.2
percent) and heroin (20.6 percent). A
similar pattern was seen from 2015 to
2019. HHS Basis for Rec. at 58.
HHS concluded that the animal
behavioral data show that D9-THC
produces rewarding properties that
underlie the abuse potential of
marijuana. Epidemiological data
demonstrate that some individuals who
use marijuana for its rewarding
properties go on to develop CUD, which
shows that marijuana can produce
psychological dependence. Among
those individuals who seek admission
for treatment for SUD associated with a
drug of abuse, marijuana was the third
most frequently reported primary
substance of abuse. Thus, marijuana can
produce psychic dependence in some
individuals who use the drug. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 58–59.

adaptation manifested by a drug-class

specific withdrawal syndrome produced
by abrupt cessation, rapid dose
reduction, decreasing blood level of the
drug, or administration of an antagonist.
Although physical dependence is often
associated with addiction, it can be
produced by repeated administration of
drugs both with and without abuse
potential. HHS Basis for Rec. at 59.
As HHS discussed in its analysis of
Factor 2, see HHS Basis for Rec. at 11,
D9-THC is a partial agonist at CB1
receptors. When marijuana (or isolated
D9-THC) is administered chronically,
there is a down-regulation of CB1
receptors, which leads to behavioral
tolerance. The underlying mechanism
for marijuana withdrawal appears to be
the uncoupling or desensitization of CB1
receptors that precedes receptor downregulation. Abrupt discontinuation of
marijuana after prolonged
administration produces withdrawal
symptoms in rats and in humans that
are typically opposite to those that
occur with activation of the CB1
receptor. Precipitated withdrawal can
also be induced with administration of
CB1 antagonists following chronic
administration, while administration of
CB1 agonists can attenuate some
withdrawal symptoms associated with
marijuana discontinuation. These data
confirm the importance of the CB1
receptor in marijuana physical
dependence. HHS Basis for Rec. at 59.
HHS noted that research has not yet
documented the occurrence of
withdrawal symptoms in individuals
who use marijuana only occasionally.
However, in individuals who use
marijuana heavily and chronically, drug
discontinuation can lead to a
withdrawal syndrome. Most marijuana
withdrawal symptoms begin within 24
to 48 hours of drug discontinuation,
peak within two to six days, and reduce
over one to two weeks as D9-THC levels
decline. HHS Basis for Rec. at 59.
The most commonly reported
withdrawal symptoms from clinical
investigations are sleep difficulties,
decreased appetite and weight loss,
craving, irritability, anger, anxiety or
nervousness, and restlessness. Less
commonly reported withdrawal
symptoms include depressed mood,
sweating, shakiness, physical
discomfort, and chills. HHS described
the symptoms of ‘‘cannabis withdrawal’’
listed in the DSM–V as being similar to
those reported in the experimental
studies, including nervousness or
anxiety, irritability or aggression,
insomnia or unpleasant dreams,
depressed mood, decreased appetite or
weight loss, restlessness, abdominal
pain, shakiness or tremors, sweating,
fever, chills, and headache. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 59–60.
HHS reported that up to 40 to 50
percent of individuals who use
marijuana on a regular basis may
experience physical dependence. A
meta-analysis of 23,518 individuals who
frequently used marijuana showed that
47 percent of subjects reported
symptoms of marijuana withdrawal. The
prevalence of physical dependence was
54 percent in outpatient samples, 17
percent in community samples, and 87
percent among inpatients in drug abuse
treatment centers. This is consistent
with data showing that 90 percent of
individuals who were diagnosed with
CUD also reported physical
dependence. Further, individuals
diagnosed with CUD experience more
severe and longer lasting withdrawal
symptoms when discontinuing
marijuana than individuals who do not
have a diagnosis of CUD. This may be
because individuals with CUD have
greater exposure to marijuana. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 60.
Symptoms associated with marijuana
withdrawal appear to be relatively mild
compared to those associated with
alcohol withdrawal, which can include
agitation, paranoia, seizures, and even
death. Multiple studies comparing the
withdrawal symptoms associated with
tobacco (not scheduled in the CSA) and
marijuana demonstrate that the
magnitude and time course of the two
withdrawal syndromes are similar.
Animal studies have shown that after
short-term administration of
equianalgesic doses of heroin and D9-
THC to monkeys, withdrawal signs were
observed after heroin administration but
not after D9-THC administration, further
demonstrating that withdrawal from
marijuana is associated with less severe
symptoms than withdrawal from other
drug classes. HHS Basis for Rec. at 60.
HHS Conclusion With Respect to
Factor 7
In conclusion, HHS found
experimental and clinical evidence that
chronic, but not acute, use of marijuana
can produce both psychic and physical
dependence in humans.
Epidemiological data, discussed in
greater detail in the sections describing
Factors 4 and 5 in sections VI.4 and VI.5
of this preamble, provide additional
evidence of psychic dependence. The
symptoms associated with both kinds of
dependence are relatively mild for most
individuals, although their severity may
be greater with increased exposure to
marijuana. HHS Basis for Rec. at 61.
In 2016, DEA found that ‘‘[l]ong-term,
heavy use of marijuana can lead to
physical dependence and withdrawal
following discontinuation, as well as
psychic or psychological dependence.’’
81 FR 53740. DEA notes that some
physicians have argued that CUD is
underdiagnosed and undertreated in the
medical setting,33 and that other
medical professionals have noted that
CUD needs to be better understood and
characterized to better inform users and
treatment professionals.34 DEA
anticipates that additional psychic or
physiological dependence liability may
be appropriate for consideration.
8. Whether Marijuana Is an Immediate
Precursor of a Substance Already
Controlled Under the CSA
The eighth factor that DOJ and HHS
are required to consider under 21 U.S.C.
811(c) is whether marijuana is an
immediate precursor of a substance
already controlled under the CSA. HHS
concluded that marijuana is not an
immediate precursor of another
controlled substance. HHS Basis for Rec.
at 61. This finding is consistent with
DEA’s finding in 2016. 81 FR 53740.
DEA welcomes additional information
on this factor.
VII. Determination of Appropriate
Schedule for Marijuana
After conducting the eight-factor
analysis in 2023, HHS has
recommended three findings regarding
the appropriate schedule in which to
place marijuana. The three findings
relate to: (1) a substance’s abuse
potential; (2) whether the substance has
a CAMU; and (3) the safety or
dependence potential of the substance.
21 U.S.C. 812(b); HHS Basis for Rec. at
62–65.
1. Potential for Abuse
In 2016, HHS found that many factors
indicated marijuana’s high abuse
potential, ‘‘including the large number
of individuals regularly using
marijuana, marijuana’s widespread use,
and the vast amount of marijuana
available for illicit use.’’ 81 FR 53688 at
53706. As a result of its most recent
evaluation, which incorporates post2016 data into its analysis, HHS has
recommended a finding that marijuana
has a potential for abuse less than the

I and II.

Marijuana contains D9-THC (also
known as dronabinol when specifically
referring to (-)-trans-D9-THC
stereoisomer), the substance responsible
for the abuse potential of marijuana. D9-
THC has agonist properties at CB1
cannabinoid receptors and produces
rewarding responses in animals, as
evidenced by its ability to produce selfadministration and CPP. When
marijuana is administered to humans
under experimental conditions, it
produces a wide range of positive
subjective responses in addition to
certain negative subjective responses.
Common responses to marijuana when
it is used by individuals for nonmedical
purposes include euphoria and other
positive subjective responses, as well as
perceptual changes, sedative responses,
anxiety responses, psychiatric, social,
and cognitive changes, and
physiological changes. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 62.
HHS noted that epidemiological data
from NSDUH show that marijuana is the
most frequently used federally illicit
drug in the United States on a past-year
and past-month basis among the illicit
comparator drugs considered. Although
50 percent of respondents in NSDUH
reported using marijuana nonmedically
fewer than 5 days per month, another 30
percent reported using it nonmedically
for 20 days or more per month. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 62.
Despite the high prevalence of
nonmedical use of marijuana, HHS
observed that an overall evaluation of
epidemiological indicators suggests that
it does not produce serious outcomes
compared to drugs in schedules I or II.
HHS found this especially notable given
the availability of marijuana and
marijuana-derived products that contain
extremely high levels of D9-THC. Due to
such availability, the epidemiological
data described in HHS’s evaluation
inherently include the outcomes from
individuals who use marijuana and
marijuana-derived products that have
doses of D9-THC that range from low to
very high, and yet the data demonstrate
that these products overall are
producing fewer negative outcomes than
drugs in schedules I or II. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 62.
HHS compared the rank ordering of
selected drugs that are abused for
various epidemiological measures and
observed that marijuana was among the
drugs at the very lowest ranking for a
number of measures, including PC
abuse cases, likelihood that any use
would lead to a PC call, accidental or
unintentional poisoning, utilizationadjusted rates of unintentional
exposure, utilization-adjusted and
population-adjusted rates for ED visits
and hospitalizations, likelihood of being
diagnosed with a serious SUD, deaths
reported to PCs, and overdose deaths
when used with other drugs or as a
single substance (as total numbers and
when utilization-adjusted). In contrast,
comparators such as heroin (schedule I),
oxycodone (schedule II), and cocaine
(schedule II) typically were in the
highest rank ordering on these
measures. HHS Basis for Rec. at 62.
For the various epidemiological
measures evaluated above, HHS noted
that marijuana was also compared to
controlled substances in schedule III
(ketamine) and schedule IV
(benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and
tramadol), as well as to other schedule
II substances (fentanyl and
hydrocodone). The analyses were
conducted in this manner to provide a
comprehensive assessment of the
relative abuse potential of marijuana.
However, the rank order of these
substances regarding harms does not
consistently align with the relative
scheduling placement of these drugs in
the CSA due to the pharmacological
differences between various classes of
drugs. HHS Basis for Rec. at 63.
There are a number of confounding
factors that likely influence the adverse
outcomes measured in various
epidemiological databases and account
for the rank ordering of the drugs
evaluated on these measures. For
example, a different population abuses
each substance, and each substance has
a different prevalence of abuse and a
different profile of severe adverse
outcomes in a setting of nonmedical use
and abuse. Thus, it is challenging to
reconcile the ranking of relative harms
associated with the comparators used in
this evaluation when the rankings differ
across various epidemiological
databases and when these rankings
often do not align with the scheduling
placement of these comparators under
the CSA. HHS Basis for Rec. at 63.
To address these challenges, HHS
evaluated the totality of the available
data and has concluded that it supports
the placement of marijuana in schedule
III. Overall, these data demonstrate that,
although marijuana is associated with a
high prevalence of abuse, the profile of
and propensity for serious outcomes
related to that abuse lead to a
conclusion that marijuana is most
appropriately controlled in schedule III
under the CSA. HHS Basis for Rec. at
63.
The Attorney General has considered
HHS’s recommendations and
conclusions and accords HHS’s
scientific and medical determinations
binding weight at this stage of the
scheduling process. See OLC Op. at *22
n.6 (‘‘HHS’s recommendations with
respect to ‘scientific and medical
matters’ are binding for all eight factors
listed in section 811(c).’’). The Attorney
General concurs with HHS’s
recommendation, for purposes of
initiation of these rulemaking
proceedings, that marijuana has a
potential for abuse less than the drugs
or other substances in schedules I and
II.
2. Currently Accepted Medical Use in
Treatment in the United States
In 2016, HHS recommended a finding
that marijuana had no CAMU due in
part to a lack of adequate safety studies
or evidence that qualified experts
accepted marijuana for use in treating a
specific, recognized disorder. 81 FR
53688 at 53707. As a result of its most
recent evaluation, which incorporates
post-2016 data into its analysis, HHS
recommends a finding that marijuana
has a CAMU.
In making that recommendation, HHS
analyzed whether there is (1)
widespread current experience with
medical use of the substance in the
United States by licensed health care
practitioners operating in accordance
with implemented State-authorized
programs, where the medical use is
recognized by entities that regulate the
practice of medicine; and (2) some
credible scientific support for a least
one of those medical uses. Applying this
test, HHS recommended a finding that
marijuana has a currently accepted
medical use in the United States,
specifically for the treatment of anorexia
related to a medical condition, nausea
and vomiting (e.g., chemotherapyinduced), and pain. According to HHS,
its evaluation also supported a finding
that there is accepted safety for the use
of marijuana under medical supervision
for the treatment of anorexia related to
a medical condition, nausea and
vomiting (e.g., chemotherapy-induced),
and pain. HHS Basis for Rec. at 63–64.
In the past, DEA has concluded that
a substance has a CAMU under the CSA
only if one of two tests is satisfied. First,
DEA has determined that a substance
has a CAMU if the substance has been
approved by FDA for marketing under
the FDCA, either through the NDA
process or by meeting the criteria to be
recognized as a ‘‘Generally Recognized
As Safe and Effective’’ (‘‘GRASE’’) drug.
57 FR 10499, 10503 (March 26, 1992).
Second, DEA has determined a
substance has a CAMU if the substance
satisfies a five-part test established by
DEA in 1992 that was based on the
‘‘core FDCA standards for acceptance of
drugs for medical use’’:

Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 99 / Tuesday, May 21, 2024 / Proposed Rules 44617
35 In Part 1 of the CAMU test, OASH identified
at least 15 medical conditions for which there is
widespread current experience with medical use of
marijuana in the United States by licensed HCPs
operating in accordance with implemented Stateauthorized programs, where the medical use is
recognized by entities that regulate the practice of
medicine. These conditions include amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (commonly known as ALSI),
autism, cachexia, cancer, chronic pain, Crohn’s
disease, epilepsy or condition causing seizures,
glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis,
Parkinson’s disease, persistent/severe muscle
spasm, persistent/severe nausea, PTSD, and
spasticity. FDA conducted Part 2 of the analysis for
the medical conditions identified by OASH that
were likely to have the most robust evidence
available for review; because the analysis
concluded that the Part 2 test has been met for at
least one of the conditions identified in Part 1, there
was no need to analyze all of them. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 25 n.9.
36The anorexia indication reflects anorexia due to
a medical condition (e.g., HIV/AIDS) and does not
represent anorexia nervosa. HHS Basis for Rec. at
25 n.10.
37While anxiety was not one of the specific
medical conditions identified by OASH, it is
included herein because anxiety was identified by
the FDA during the Part 2 review of State-level
usage data. FDA considered the medical use of
marijuana for the treatment of anxiety of
importance to evaluate given the reported
prevalence of marijuana use for the treatment of
anxiety regardless of the legal status of such use in
a given jurisdiction. HHS Basis for Rec. at 25 n.11.
1. There must be adequate safety
studies;
2. The drug’s chemistry must be
known and reproducible;
3. There must be adequate and wellcontrolled studies proving efficacy;
4. The drug must be accepted by
qualified experts; and
5. The scientific evidence must be
widely available.
57 FR 10499, 10503–06 (1992); see also
All. for Cannabis Therapeutics v. DEA,
15 F.3d 1131, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 1994).
In its most recent evaluation, HHS
informed DEA of its view that DEA’s
previous approach to determining
whether a drug has a CAMU does not
adequately account for certain indicia of
medical use that, where present, are
relevant to determining whether a
substance has a CAMU for purposes of
scheduling under the CSA. Specifically,
HHS observed that DEA’s tests left no
room for an evaluation of (1) whether
there is widespread medical use of a
drug under the supervision of licensed
health care practitioners under Stateauthorized programs and, (2) if so,
whether there is credible scientific
evidence supporting such medical use.
HHS therefore developed an alternative
test composed of those two inquiries as
a third, independently sufficient
approach for determining whether a
substance has a CAMU under the CSA.
HHS applied this two-part test to
marijuana and recommended a finding
that marijuana has a CAMU under the
CSA. HHS Basis for Rec. at 24–28.
Upon receiving HHS’s
recommendation, the Attorney General
requested that OLC advise on whether
HHS’s test, if satisfied, established a
CAMU ‘‘even if the drug has not been
approved by FDA and even if the drug
does not satisfy DEA’s five-part test.’’
OLC Op. at *3. OLC determined that
DEA’s current approach to determining
whether a drug has a CAMU is
impermissibly narrow, because it
‘‘ignor[es] widespread clinical
experience with a drug that is
sanctioned by state medical licensing
regulators.’’ Id. at *13–14; see also id. at
*12. OLC further opined that satisfying
HHS’s two-part inquiry is sufficient to
establish that a drug has a CAMU. Id. at
*4, *16–20. And OLC concluded that,
while HHS’s CAMU recommendation is
not binding on DEA, the medical and
scientific determinations that underlie
its recommendation are binding until
the initiation of formal rulemaking
proceedings, and that DEA must accord
those determinations ‘‘significant
deference’’ throughout the rulemaking
process. Id. at *4, *20–26.
Under Part 1 of the HHS CAMU test,
the Office of the Assistant Secretary for
Health (‘‘OASH’’) considered whether
there is widespread current experience
with medical use of marijuana in the
United States by licensed HCPs
operating in accordance with
implemented State-authorized
programs, where such medical use is
recognized by entities that regulate the
practice of medicine under these State
jurisdictions. Part 2 of the CAMU test
evaluated whether there exists some
credible scientific support for at least
one of the medical conditions for which
the Part 1 test is satisfied. The
evaluation in Part 2, undertaken by
FDA, was not meant to be, nor is it, a
determination of safety and efficacy
under the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act’s drug approval standard
for new human or animal drugs. Rather,
HHS’s two-part test is designed to
evaluate whether a substance, in this
case marijuana, has a CAMU for
purposes of drug scheduling
recommendations and placement in a
drug schedule consistent with criteria
set forth in 21 U.S.C. 812(b). HHS Basis
for Rec. at 24.
In the evaluation and assessment
under Part 1 of the CAMU test, OASH
found that more than 30,000 HCPs are
authorized to recommend the use of
marijuana for more than six million
registered patients, constituting
widespread clinical experience
associated with various medical
conditions recognized by a substantial
number of jurisdictions across the
United States. For several jurisdictions,
these programs have been in place for
several years, and include features that
actively monitor medical use and
product quality characteristics of
marijuana dispensed. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 24.
Based on OASH’s findings in Part 1 of
the CAMU test, the Assistant Secretary
for Health concluded that an FDA
assessment under Part 2 of the CAMU
test was warranted to determine if
credible scientific support exists for the
use of marijuana to treat at least one of
the medical conditions identified by
OASH under Part 1. HHS Basis for Rec.
at 24.
At this stage of initiating a
rulemaking, the Attorney General agrees
with OASH that there is widespread
clinical experience with marijuana for at
least one medical condition.
FDA conducted Part 2 of the CAMU
test for seven indications, based in part
on OASH’s findings under Part 1 of the
CAMU test 35 and in part on FDA’s own
analysis of the landscape in which
marijuana is currently used medically,
including information from Stateauthorized programs on how and to
what extent marijuana is being utilized
for medical purposes. The seven
indications are: (1) anorexia; 36 (2)
anxiety; 37 (3) epilepsy; (4) inflammatory
bowel disease (‘‘IBD’’); (5) nausea and
vomiting; (6) pain; and (7) posttraumatic stress disorder (‘‘PTSD’’).
FDA’s evaluation under Part 2 of the
CAMU test was based on systematic
reviews of studies investigating the
safety and effectiveness of marijuana,
relevant professional societies’ position
statements, data from State medical
marijuana programs and United States
national surveys, and the labeling of
FDA-approved products relevant to the
analysis. HHS Basis for Rec. at 25.
In evaluating whether there exists
some credible scientific support under
Part 2 of the CAMU test for a particular
use, factors in favor of a positive finding
included whether: (1) favorable clinical
studies of the medical use of marijuana,
although not necessarily adequate and
well-controlled clinical studies that
would support approval of an NDA,
have been published in peer-reviewed
journals or (2) qualified expert
organizations (e.g., academic groups,
professional societies, or government
agencies) have opined in favor of the
medical use or provided guidance to
HCPs on the medical use. Factors that
weigh against a finding that Part 2 of the
CAMU test is met included whether: (1)
data or information indicate that
medical use of the substance is
associated with unacceptably high

38The term ‘‘substantial evidence’’ refers to
language used within the 2017 NASEM report and
is not meant to represent ‘‘substantial evidence’’ as
defined in 21 U.S.C. 355(d). HHS Basis for Rec. at
26 n.12.
safety risks for the likely patient
population, e.g., due to toxicity
concerns; (2) clinical studies with
negative efficacy findings for the
medical use of marijuana have been
published in peer reviewed journals; or
(3) qualified expert organizations (e.g.,
academic or professional societies,
government agencies) recommend
against the medical use of marijuana
based on the available data at the time
of their position statement. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 25.
FDA’s review of the available
information identified mixed findings of
effectiveness across indications, ranging
from data showing inconclusive
findings to considerable evidence in
favor of effectiveness, depending on the
source. The largest evidence base for
effectiveness exists for marijuana use
within the pain indication (in
particular, neuropathic pain). Numerous
systematic reviews concluded that there
exists some level of evidence supporting
the use of marijuana for chronic pain.
The 2017 NASEM report concluded
there was ‘‘substantial evidence’’ 38
supporting the use of cannabis products
relevant to this review for pain, as have
other reviews. The AHRQ living
systematic review has concluded that
there is some support for the use of
marijuana-related products in the
treatment of chronic pain, but overall
concluded these effects were small and
the increased risk of dizziness, nausea,
and sedation may limit the benefit. A
systematic review of scientific and
medical literature was conducted in
2023 by the University of Florida (‘‘UF’’)
under contract with FDA. UF
epidemiologists identified some data
supporting effectiveness of marijuana,
including some within their own metaanalysis; however, they ultimately
concluded the results are inconclusive
or mixed. FDA also conducted a
separate analysis of published scientific
reviews, several of which drew
conclusions similar to those of UF. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 25–26.
UF evaluated other therapeutic
conditions mentioned above, i.e.,
anorexia, anxiety, epilepsy, IBD, nausea,
and PTSD, employing a similar
systematic review of scientific and
medical literature. UF found that there
is low- to moderate-quality evidence
supporting the use of marijuana as
medical treatment for outcomes in
anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and
PTSD. FDA’s review of systematic
reviews showed mixed results for these
indications. In particular, FDA found
that the potential for psychiatric adverse
events associated with treating PTSD
with marijuana may be more substantial
than any limited benefit in
observational studies. Although UF did
not conclude that there was evidence in
support of the effectiveness of marijuana
in IBD, both their review and other
systematic reviews found some benefit
with respect to subjective symptoms in
this condition. With regard to epilepsy
and anxiety, both UF’s review and
FDA’s review of other systematic
reviews did not find support for
marijuana providing benefit in the
treatment of these conditions. Where
positive results on effectiveness
outcome measures were found, the
effects and the quality of evidence were
generally in the low-to-moderate range.
UF did not find high quality evidence
supporting worsening of outcomes in
any indication. HHS Basis for Rec. at 26.
FDA concluded that none of the
evidence from the systematic reviews
included in the CAMU test Part 2
analysis identified any safety concerns
that would preclude the use of
marijuana in the indications for which
there exists some credible scientific
support for its therapeutic benefit. FDA
assessed the clinical safety data
identified in the literature from
controlled trials as generally consistent
between sources but limited in the rigor
of safety reporting. FDA also explained
that the vast majority of the
observational studies evaluated in the
context of medical use were excluded
from the final synthesis of evidence due
to concerns regarding their quality (e.g.,
only one observational study for the
anxiety indication and one for the PTSD
indication were included). According to
FDA, data on safety from both clinical
trials and observational studies were
generally scarce, but the literature
shows that marijuana has more AEs
when compared to a placebo or active
control group, however, typically in the
mild to moderate severity range. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 26.
FDA also reviewed results from State
reporting data from 37 States with
medical marijuana programs and
surveys of patients using marijuana in
Maryland and Minnesota, which had
data available for review. Surveys of
patients using marijuana in these two
States found most patients did not
report any side effects and those that
did report side effects mostly described
them as mild. Neither State’s databases
included patients who chose to stop
using marijuana, which FDA noted
might result in an overestimation of
positive experiences. HHS Basis for Rec.
at 27.
As of August 2023, FDA reported that
the real-world data sources available to
FDA, in general, lack the necessary
elements to identify the exposure (i.e.,
to marijuana), to distinguish the reason
for use (medical vs. recreational) and, if
applicable, the condition that prompted
its medical use, and to permit sound
inferential analyses. Therefore, they
were not included in HHS’s review.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 27.
According to FDA, data from United
States national surveys, in general,
lacked details on patient characteristics
and factors that prompted the use of
marijuana for medical purposes, and
data collection for these surveys was
impacted by the COVID–19 pandemic.
FDA observed that, despite these
limitations, the data suggested that
medical use of marijuana increases as
age increases. Only data from one
survey provided information on the
intended indication for use, suggesting
that individuals often use marijuana to
improve or manage conditions such as
depression, anxiety, PTSD, pain,
headaches or migraines, sleep disorders,
nausea and vomiting, lack of appetite,
and muscle spasms, but only
approximately half of them reportedly
had ever asked a health care
professional for a recommendation to
use medical marijuana. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 27.
Additionally, although the safety data
obtained from use in a medical context
are considered to be the most relevant
for the CAMU analysis, FDA evaluated
the safety of marijuana in the
nonmedical setting to inform the
potential for more severe outcomes.
Specifically, FDA evaluated safety
outcomes related to marijuana use in the
setting of nonmedical use, use of
uncertain intent, and unintentional
exposure through a variety of
epidemiological data sources and in
relation to several comparator
substances controlled under the CSA,
including drugs in schedule I: heroin
(an illicit opioid drug); schedule II:
hydrocodone and oxycodone (approved
opioid prescription drug products),
cocaine and fentanyl (largely illicitly
produced drugs in the nonmedical use
setting, although there are approved
prescription drugs); schedule III:
ketamine (an approved prescription
drug); and schedule IV: zolpidem,
benzodiazepines, and tramadol
(approved prescription drugs).
According to FDA, the comparative data
demonstrate that, even in the context of
nonmedical use, marijuana has a less
concerning overall safety profile relative
to the comparators for a number of
important outcomes (e.g., single
substance use overdose death,

Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 99 / Tuesday, May 21, 2024 / Proposed Rules 44619
hospitalizations). However, FDA
observed that in young children,
population-adjusted rates of ED visits
and hospitalizations involving
marijuana poisoning were higher than
heroin, cocaine, and benzodiazepines
for the periods studied. Of note, some of
the comparator substances are approved
for use in conditions similar to the
indications for which marijuana was
evaluated in the CAMU analysis (e.g.,
opioids for pain, benzodiazepines for
anxiety-related conditions). HHS Basis
for Rec. at 27.
FDA also considered position
statements from professional
organizations relevant to the indications
discussed. The vast majority of
professional organizations did not
recommend the use of marijuana in
their respective specialties; however,
none specifically recommended against
it, with the exception of the American
Psychiatric Association, which stated
that marijuana is known to worsen
certain psychiatric conditions. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 27–28.
On balance, FDA found the available
data indicated that there is some
credible scientific support for the use of
marijuana in the treatment of chronic
pain, anorexia related to a medical
condition, and nausea and vomiting,
with varying degrees of support and
consistency of findings. Additionally,
no safety concerns were identified in
FDA’s review that would indicate that
medical use of marijuana poses
unacceptably high safety risks for the
indications where there is some credible
scientific evidence supporting its
therapeutic use. HHS Basis for Rec. at
28.
Based on the totality of the available
data, FDA concluded that there exists
some credible scientific support for the
medical use of marijuana in at least one
of the indications for which there is
widespread current experience in the
United States, as identified by OASH
under Part 1 of the CAMU test. The
indications evaluated were anorexia
related to a medical condition, anxiety,
epilepsy, IBD, nausea and vomiting
(e.g., chemotherapy-induced), pain, and
PTSD. FDA clarified that the analysis
and conclusions on the available data
are not meant to imply that safety and
effectiveness have been established for
marijuana that would support FDA
approval of a marijuana drug product
for a particular indication. However,
FDA determined that the available data
do provide some level of support for the
way marijuana is being recommended
by health care practitioners in clinical
practice. Thus, based on the widespread
HCP experience and the extent of
medical use evaluated by OASH under
the Part 1 test, and FDA’s evaluation of
available credible scientific support
described herein for at least some
therapeutic uses identified in the Part 1
test, HHS recommended a finding that,
for purposes of the drug scheduling
criteria in 21 U.S.C. 812(b), marijuana
has a CAMU for: anorexia related to a
medical condition; nausea and vomiting
(e.g., chemotherapy-induced); and pain.
HHS Basis for Rec. at 28.
The Attorney General has considered
HHS’s recommendations and
conclusions and accords HHS’s
scientific and medical determinations
binding weight until the initiation of the
formal rulemaking process. See OLC Op.
at *24. Applying HHS’s two-part test,
and in light of OLC’s legal opinion that
the HHS’s test is sufficient under the
CSA, the Attorney General concurs with
HHS’s conclusion, for purposes of the
initiation of these rulemaking
proceedings, that there is a CAMU for
marijuana.
3. Level of Physical or Psychological
Dependence
As a result of its most recent
evaluation, which incorporates post2016 data into its analysis, HHS has
recommended a finding that abuse of
marijuana may lead to moderate or low
physical dependence or high
psychological dependence. HHS Basis
for Rec. at 65.
According to HHS, clinical studies
have demonstrated that marijuana
produces physical and psychological
dependence. Regarding physical
dependence, as evidenced by its
associated withdrawal symptomology
upon abrupt discontinuation of use, the
most commonly reported marijuana
withdrawal symptoms in clinical
investigations are sleep difficulties,
decreased appetite and weight loss,
craving, irritability, anger, anxiety or
nervousness, and restlessness.
Marijuana withdrawal symptoms
typically peak within two to six days
and decline over one to two weeks as
D9-THC is eliminated. Similarly, the
drug labels for the FDA-approved drug
products Marinol and Syndros state
that, following chronic administration
of dronabinol, drug discontinuation
leads to irritability, insomnia, and
restlessness at 12 hours, and by 24
hours the withdrawal symptoms can
include hot flashes, sweating,
rhinorrhea, diarrhea, and anorexia. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 64.
HHS observes that marijuana
withdrawal syndrome has been reported
in individuals with heavy, chronic
marijuana use, but its occurrence in
occasional users of marijuana has not
been established. The marijuana
withdrawal syndrome appears to be
relatively mild compared to the
withdrawal syndrome associated with
alcohol, which can include more serious
symptoms such as agitation, paranoia,
seizures and even death. Multiple
studies comparing the withdrawal
symptoms associated with marijuana
and tobacco demonstrate that the
magnitude and time course of the two
withdrawal syndromes are similar. HHS
Basis for Rec. at 64.
HHS also notes that the ability of
marijuana to produce psychic
dependence is shown through its ability
to produce rewarding effects that
underlie its nonmedical use and
epidemiological outcomes related to
abuse, as detailed in the first finding on
abuse potential. HHS Basis for Rec. at
64–65.
Based on the evidence, HHS
determined that the abuse of marijuana
may lead to moderate or low physical
dependence, depending on frequency
and degree of marijuana exposure. HHS
further concluded that marijuana can
produce psychic dependence in some
individuals, but that the likelihood of
serious outcomes is low, suggesting that
high psychological dependence does not
occur in most individuals who use
marijuana. HHS Basis for Rec. at 65.
The Attorney General has considered
HHS’s recommendations and
conclusions and accords HHS’s
scientific and medical determinations
binding weight at this stage of the
scheduling process. See OLC Op. at *22
n.6. For purposes of the initiation of
these rulemaking proceedings, the
Attorney General concurs with HHS’s
conclusion that the abuse of marijuana
may lead to moderate or low physical
dependence, depending on frequency
and degree of marijuana exposure.
Determination To Propose Rescheduling
Marijuana to Schedule III
HHS has recommended a finding that
marijuana has a CAMU. HHS Basis for
Rec. at 63–64. After considering the
foregoing facts and data and the
recommendation of HHS, and after
according binding weight to HHS’s
scientific and medical determinations,
the Attorney General concludes that
there is, at present, substantial evidence
that marijuana does not warrant control
under schedule I of the CSA.
Accordingly, the Attorney General is
issuing this notice of proposed
rulemaking to initiate rulemaking
proceedings to reschedule marijuana. 21
U.S.C. 811(b).
HHS has recommended that

39As noted above, OLC and the D.C. Circuit do
not understand the ‘‘without regard’’ clause in
section 811(d)(1) as prohibiting the Attorney
General from following the normal scheduling
practices when international obligations are
involved. Instead, they have interpreted it as
requiring the Attorney General to identify which
schedules would satisfy the international
obligations of the United States with respect to a
particular drug and, if more than one schedule
would do so, to select among schedules using the
procedures set forth in sections 811(a), 811(b), and
812(b). See OLC Op. at *29 n.8; NORML II, 559 F.2d
at 747.
40Under the Single Convention, ‘‘‘[c]annabis
plant’ means any plant of the genus Cannabis.’’
Single Convention art. 1(1)(c). The Single
Convention defines ‘‘cannabis’’ to mean ‘‘the
flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant
(excluding the seeds and leaves when not
accompanied by the tops) from which the resin has
not been extracted, by whatever name they may be
designated.’’ Id. art. 1(1)(b). This definition of
‘‘cannabis’’ under the Single Convention is slightly
less inclusive in certain respects than the CSA
definition of ‘‘marijuana,’’ which includes all parts
of the cannabis plant except for the mature stalks,
sterilized seeds, oil from the seeds, and certain
derivatives thereof. See 21 U.S.C. 802(16). Cannabis
and cannabis resin are included in the list of drugs
in Schedule I of the Single Convention, and
cannabis is subject to the same controls as Schedule
I drugs as well as additional controls. See Single
Convention art. 2(6); id. art. 28.
evaluation that the drug has a relatively
lower level of abuse compared to drugs
currently scheduled in schedules I and
II and its evaluation that marijuana may
lead to moderate or low physical
dependence and has a low likelihood of
psychic dependence. Consistent with
HHS’s analysis, the Attorney General
has determined at this initial stage that
marijuana does not appear to meet the
elements of a schedule II drug, which
include a high potential for abuse and
a likelihood of severe physiological or
physical dependence from such abuse.
21 U.S.C. 812(b)(3). Rather, marijuana’s
profile as a drug with a lower degree of
abuse potential than schedule I (e.g.,
heroin) and schedule II (e.g., fentanyl,
cocaine) drugs and a moderate to low
level of physical dependence militates
in favor of rescheduling it in schedule
III. Accordingly, in this notice of
proposed rulemaking, the Attorney
General is proposing to reschedule
marijuana in schedule III and solicits
comments on these preliminary
findings.
Types of Marijuana To Be Rescheduled
This rescheduling of marijuana would
apply to marijuana as listed in 21 CFR
1308.11(d)(23). The rescheduling also
would apply to marijuana extracts as
defined in 21 CFR 1308.11(d)(58)
because they meet the statutory
definition of marijuana and, prior to
2017, were included in 21 CFR
1308.11(d)(23). See Establishment of a
New Drug Code for Marihuana Extract,
81 FR 90194 (Dec. 14, 2016). In
addition, this proposal would apply to
D9-THC derived from the marijuana
plant (other than the mature stalks and
seeds) that falls outside the definition of
hemp, because it meets the statutory
definition of marijuana.
This proposal would not apply to
synthetically derived THC, which is
outside the CSA’s definition of
marijuana. Those tetrahydrocannabinols
that can be derived only through a
process of artificial synthesis (e.g., delta10-tetrahydrocannabinol) are excluded.
HHS provided a recommendation only
relating to ‘‘marijuana’’ as defined in the
CSA. That definition is limited to the
plant (other than the mature stalks and
seeds) and derivatives of the plant.
Therefore, synthetic THC will remain in
schedule I. This rulemaking would not
affect the status of hemp (as defined in
7 U.S.C. 1639o), because hemp is
excluded from the definition of
marijuana. This rulemaking is not
proposing to reschedule any drug
product containing marijuana or THC
that previously has been rescheduled
out of schedule I (e.g., Marinol and
Syndros). Nor does it impact the status
of any previously scheduled synthetic
cannabinoids.
VIII. International Treaty Obligations
In proposing an appropriate schedule
for marijuana, the Attorney General
must also consider compliance with the
treaty obligations of the United States.
As the CSA recognizes, the United
States is a party to the Single
Convention. 21 U.S.C. 801(7). Parties to
the Single Convention are obligated to
maintain various control provisions
related to the drugs that are covered by
the treaty. See, e.g., Single Convention
arts. 2, 4. Congress enacted many of the
CSA’s provisions for the specific
purpose of ensuring U.S. compliance
with the treaty. See OLC Op. at *27.
Among these is a scheduling provision,
21 U.S.C. 811(d)(1). Section 811(d)(1)
provides that, where a drug is subject to
control under the Single Convention,
the Attorney General must ‘‘issue an
order controlling such drug under the
schedule he deems most appropriate to
carry out such [treaty] obligations,
without regard to the findings required
by [21 U.S.C. 811(a) or 812(b)] and
without regard to the procedures
prescribed by [21 U.S.C. 811(a) and
(b)].’’ 39
Marijuana is a drug covered in the
Single Convention under the term
‘‘cannabis.’’ 40 OLC initially advised in
1972 that controls under Article 21 of
the Single Convention would not be
satisfied if marijuana were listed in
schedule III, IV, or V of the CSA.
Memorandum for John E. Ingersoll,
Director, Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs, from Mary C. Lawton,
Deputy Assistant Attorney General,
Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Petition to
Decontrol Marihuana; Interpretation of
Section 201 of the Controlled
Substances Act of 1970 at 12–13 (Aug.
21, 1972). However, OLC has
reexamined the conclusion of its 1972
memorandum, taking into account
statutory amendments since 1972 and a
possibility it did not consider in 1972:
placing marijuana into schedule III
while issuing regulations that would
enable the United States to comply with
its international obligations. OLC Op. at
*4, 26–35. OLC has concluded that both
the Single Convention and the CSA
allow the Attorney General to satisfy the
treaty obligations of the United States
with respect to marijuana by
supplementing scheduling decisions
with additional controls under the CSA.
Id.
If marijuana were listed in schedule
III, most of the Single Convention’s
obligations would continue to be met by
CSA statutory authorities and associated
regulations. See OLC Op. at *33–34.
One potential gap concerns the quota on
manufacturing cannabis required by
Article 21 of the Convention, but that
gap can be filled using the CSA’s
regulatory authorities. See id. at *34; see
also, e.g., 21 U.S.C. 821 (authorizing the
Attorney General to impose restrictions
‘‘relate[ed] to the . . . control of the
manufacture’’ of a drug); id. 871(b)
(authorizing the Attorney General to
issue regulations ‘‘necessary and
appropriate for the efficient execution of
his functions under this subchapter’’);
id. 822(b) (allowing the Attorney
General to regulate ‘‘the extent’’ of
manufacture of a drug through
registration); id. 823(e) (requiring the
Attorney General to register an
applicant to manufacture a schedule III
drug ‘‘unless he determines that the
issuance of such registration is
inconsistent with the public interest’’).
In addition, if marijuana is transferred
into schedule III, DEA will continue to
have authority to maintain its existing
regulatory scheme, located at 21 CFR
part 1318, governing the registration of
manufacturers seeking to plant, grow,
cultivate, or harvest marijuana, as
required to comply with Articles 23 and
28 of the Single Convention. Authority
for those regulations currently flows
from 21 U.S.C. 823(a), which is
applicable to drugs in schedules I and
II. OLC has concluded, however, that 21
U.S.C. 823(e), which is applicable to
drugs in schedules III, IV, and V,
provides an alternative source of
authority for complying with Articles 23
and 28 of the Single Convention. See
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:01 May 20, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\21MYP1.SGM 21MYP1

Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 99 / Tuesday, May 21, 2024 / Proposed Rules 44621
OLC Op. at *34 n.9. The CSA also
recognizes that the United States is also
a party to the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971,
32 U.S.T. 543, 1019 U.N.T.S. 175
(‘‘Convention on Psychotropic
Substances’’). See also 21 U.S.C.
801a(2). As with the Single Convention,
parties to the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances are obligated
to take various control measures related
to the drugs that are covered by the
treaty. Id. Congress implemented the
additional authority necessary to
comply with the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances through
various amendments to the CSA. Id.
801a(2)–(3).
D9-THC is a substance covered by
schedule II of the Convention on
Psychotropic Substances. In this rule,
DOJ proposes to reschedule D9-THC that
falls within the CSA’s definition of
marijuana into CSA schedule III. As is
the case for marijuana under the Single
Convention, the controls available
under CSA schedule III are sufficient to
comply with the requirements of the
Convention on Psychotropic Substances
with respect to D9-THC, although
additional regulatory action may be
necessary to implement certain
Convention requirements, such as the
export and import authorizations
required by Article 12. See, e.g.,
Schedules of Controlled Substances:
Rescheduling of the Food and Drug
Administration Approved Product
Containing Synthetic Dronabinol [(-)-D 9
-(trans)-Tetrahydrocannabinol] in
Sesame Oil and Encapsulated in Soft
Gelatin Capsules From Schedule II to
Schedule III, 64 FR 35928, 35928 (July
2, 1999). Compare, e.g., Convention on
Psychotropic Substances art. 12(1)
(requiring export and import
authorizations for substances in
Convention Schedule II), with 21 U.S.C.
952(b)(2) (authorizing import permits
for CSA schedule III substances), and id.
953(e)(2) (authorizing export permits for
CSA schedule III substances).
Accordingly, concurrent with this
rulemaking, DEA will consider the
marijuana-specific controls that would
be necessary to meet U.S. obligations
under the Single Convention and the
Convention on Psychotropic Substances
in the event that marijuana is
rescheduled to schedule III, and, to the
extent they are needed if marijuana is
rescheduled, will seek to finalize any
such regulations as soon as possible.
IX. Requirements for Handling
Marijuana and Other Applicable
Controls
If marijuana is transferred to schedule
III, the regulatory controls applicable to
schedule III controlled substances
would apply, as appropriate, along with
existing marijuana-specific
requirements and any additional
controls that might be implemented,
including those that might be
implemented to meet U.S. treaty
obligations. The manufacture,
distribution, dispensing, and possession
of marijuana would also remain subject
to applicable criminal prohibitions
under the CSA. 21 U.S.C. 841–844.
In addition, marijuana would remain
subject to applicable provisions of the
FDCA. For example, under the FDCA, a
drug containing a substance within the
CSA’s definition of ‘‘marijuana’’ would
need FDA approval to be lawfully
‘‘introduce[d] or deliver[ed] for
introduction into interstate commerce,’’
unless an IND is in effect for that drug.
See 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 355(i), 331(d). To
date, although there have been INDs for
drugs containing a substance within the
CSA’s definition of ‘‘marijuana,’’ no
such drugs have been approved by FDA.
DOJ is seeking comment on the
practical consequences of rescheduling
marijuana into schedule III under the
relevant statutory frameworks.
Conclusion
Based on the legal opinion of OLC
and consideration of the scientific and
medical evaluation and accompanying
recommendation of HHS, the Attorney
General is initiating a rulemaking that
proposes the placement of marijuana in
schedule III of the CSA. DOJ is soliciting
comments on this proposal.
X. Regulatory Analyses
1. Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review), 13563
(Improving Regulation and Regulatory
Review) and 14094 (Modernizing
Regulatory Review)
In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(a),
this scheduling action is subject to
formal rulemaking procedures done ‘‘on
the record after opportunity for a
hearing,’’ which are conducted pursuant
to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and
557. The CSA sets forth the criteria for
removing a drug or other substance from
the list of controlled substances. Such
actions are exempt from review by the
Office of Management and Budget
pursuant to section 3(d)(1) of Executive
Order 12866 and the principles
reaffirmed in Executive Order 13563
and 14094.
While this scheduling action is
exempt from review under Executive
Order 12866, DOJ recognizes this action
may have unique economic impacts. As
stated above, marijuana is subject to a
number of State laws that have allowed
a multibillion dollar industry to
develop. DOJ acknowledges that there
may be large impacts related to Federal
taxes and research and development
investment for the pharmaceutical
industry, among other things. DOJ is
specifically soliciting comments on the
economic impact of this proposed rule.
DOJ will revise this section at the final
rule stage if warranted after
consideration of any comments
received.
2. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice
Reform)
This proposed regulation meets the
applicable standards set forth in
sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive
Order 12988 to eliminate drafting errors
and ambiguity, minimize litigation,
provide a clear legal standard for
affected conduct, and promote
simplification and burden reduction.
3. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism)
This rulemaking does not have
federalism implications warranting the
application of Executive Order 13132.
The rule does not have substantial
direct effects on the States, on the
relationship between the Federal
Government and the States, or the
distribution of power and
responsibilities among the various
levels of government.
4. Executive Order 13175 (Consultation
and Coordination With Indian Tribal
Governments)
This proposed rule does not have
Tribal implications warranting the
application of Executive Order 13175.
This rule does not have substantial
direct effects on one or more Indian
Tribes, on the relationship between the
Federal Government and Indian Tribes,
or on the distribution of power and
responsibilities between the Federal
Government and Indian Tribes.
5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
DOJ has concluded that this action
may have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5
U.S.C. 601 et seq. For example, section
280E of the Internal Revenue Code bars
businesses from claiming tax deductions
for otherwise allowable expenses where
the business ‘‘consists of trafficking in
controlled substances (within the
meaning of schedule I and II of the
Controlled Substances Act).’’ 26 U.S.C.
280E. If marijuana is ultimately
transferred to schedule III, section 280E
would no longer serve as a statutory bar
to claiming deductions for those
expenses. In addition, small entities
engaged in research on marijuana may

be subject to different research protocols
set by DEA if the research is conducted
on a schedule III substance rather than
a schedule I substance.41 However, DOJ
is currently not in a position to estimate
the number of small entities affected by
these or other potential effects of this
action. DOJ seeks comment and
additional information to inform its
analysis.
6. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of
1995
In accordance with the Unfunded
Mandates Reform Act of 1995
(‘‘UMRA’’), 2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq., DOJ
has determined that this action would
not result in any Federal mandate that
may result ‘‘in the expenditure by State,
local, and Tribal governments, in the
aggregate, or by the private sector, of
$100,000,000 or more (adjusted
annually for inflation) in any 1 year.’’
See 2 U.S.C. 1532(a). Therefore, neither
a Small Government Agency Plan nor
any other action is required under
UMRA.
7. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
This action does not impose any new
or revised ‘‘collection[s] of information’’
as defined by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3502(3).
