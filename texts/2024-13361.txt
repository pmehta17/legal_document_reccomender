The President
Notice of June 13, 2024
Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to
Belarus
On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members of the Government
of Belarus and other persons to undermine Belarus’s democratic processes
or institutions, manifested in the fundamentally undemocratic March 2006
elections; to commit human rights abuses related to political repression,
including detentions and disappearances; and to engage in public corruption,
including by diverting or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing
public authority.
On August 9, 2021, by Executive Order 14038, I expanded the scope of
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405, finding that
the Belarusian regime’s harmful activities and long-standing abuses aimed
at suppressing democracy and the exercise of human rights and fundamental
freedoms in Belarus—including illicit and oppressive activities stemming
from the August 9, 2020, fraudulent Belarusian presidential election and
its aftermath, such as the elimination of political opposition and civil society
organizations and the regime’s disruption and endangering of international
civil air travel—constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus
and other persons, and the Belarusian regime’s harmful activities and longstanding abuses, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to
the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason,
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405, which was expanded in scope in Executive Order 14038, must continue in effect beyond
June 16, 2024. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 13405.
