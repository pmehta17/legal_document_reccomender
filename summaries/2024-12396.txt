SUMMARY: The Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) proposes to amend and
clarify the regulations concerning the 9–
11 Response & Biometric Entry-Exit Fee
for H–1B and L–1 Visas (9–11 Biometric
Fee). The proposed regulatory changes
would clarify DHS’s interpretation of
ambiguous statutory language to require
that covered employers submit the 9–11
Biometric Fee for all extension-of-stay
petitions, regardless of whether a Fraud
Fee applies, so as to include extensionof-stay petitions that do not involve a
change of employer. The 9–11 Biometric
Fee would continue to apply unchanged
to petitions seeking an initial grant of
status. The proposed changes will also
help DHS comply with its congressional
mandate to implement a biometric
entry-exit data system.
