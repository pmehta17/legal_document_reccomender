SUMMARY: The USPTO proposes to
amend the rules of practice to add a new
requirement for an acceptable terminal
disclaimer that is filed to obviate (that
is, overcome) nonstatutory double
patenting. The proposed rule change
would require terminal disclaimers filed
to obviate nonstatutory double patenting
to include an agreement by the
disclaimant that the patent in which the
terminal disclaimer is filed, or any
patent granted on an application in
which a terminal disclaimer is filed,
will be enforceable only if the patent is
not tied and has never been tied directly
or indirectly to a patent by one or more
terminal disclaimers filed to obviate
nonstatutory double patenting in which:
any claim has been finally held
unpatentable or invalid as anticipated or
obvious by a Federal court in a civil
action or by the USPTO, and all appeal
rights have been exhausted; or a
statutory disclaimer of a claim is filed
after any challenge based on
anticipation or obviousness to that
claim has been made. This action is
being taken to prevent multiple patents
directed to obvious variants of an
invention from potentially deterring
competition and to promote innovation
and competition by allowing a
competitor to avoid enforcement of
patents tied by one or more terminal
disclaimers to another patent having a
claim finally held unpatentable or
invalid over prior art.
