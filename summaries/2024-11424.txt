SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) is seeking public
input to support the preparation of
proposed regulations intended to
implement the Greenhouse Gas
Technical Assistance Provider and
Third-Party Verifier Program (the
Program), particularly related to the
criteria used to evaluate protocols and
identification of specific protocols that
should be considered for inclusion in
the Program. The purpose of the
Program is to facilitate farmer, rancher,
and private forest landowner
participation in voluntary carbon
markets. This request for information
provides an important step toward
developing a meaningful Program
consistent with the Growing Climate
Solutions Act (GCSA).
