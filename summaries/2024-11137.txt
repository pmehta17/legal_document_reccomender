SUMMARY: The Department of Justice
(‘‘DOJ’’) proposes to transfer marijuana
from schedule I of the Controlled
Substances Act (‘‘CSA’’) to schedule III
of the CSA, consistent with the view of
the Department of Health and Human
Services (‘‘HHS’’) that marijuana has a
currently accepted medical use as well
as HHS’s views about marijuana’s abuse
potential and level of physical or
psychological dependence. The CSA
requires that such actions be made
through formal rulemaking on the
record after opportunity for a hearing. If
the transfer to schedule III is finalized,
the regulatory controls applicable to
schedule III controlled substances
would apply, as appropriate, along with
existing marijuana-specific
requirements and any additional
controls that might be implemented,
including those that might be
implemented to meet U.S. treaty
obligations. If marijuana is transferred
into schedule III, the manufacture,
distribution, dispensing, and possession
of marijuana would remain subject to
the applicable criminal prohibitions of
the CSA. Any drugs containing a
substance within the CSA’s definition of
‘‘marijuana’’ would also remain subject
to the applicable prohibitions in the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(‘‘FDCA’’). DOJ is soliciting comments
on this proposal.
